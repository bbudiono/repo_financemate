# Debug Plan - EmailIntentAnalyzer.swift Implementation
**Project**: FinanceMate - Gmail Transaction Extraction Fix
**Author**: Claude Code Assistant
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Priority**: P0 - Critical Fix for False Positives

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

Create EmailIntentAnalyzer.swift to prevent false positives in Gmail transaction extraction by pre-classifying emails before extraction. This fixes the critical issue where professional correspondence (like rubric emails) is incorrectly processed as receipts, creating fake transaction data.

---

## üö® PROBLEM STATEMENT

**Current Issue**: FinanceMate creates fake transactions from non-receipt emails
- Example: "Invoice#: EMAIL-199e52c4, GST: $12.90, Payment: Afterpay" from professional correspondence
- Root cause: No email intent validation before extraction
- Impact: Loss of data integrity, user trust issues, potentially dangerous fake financial data

**Target Fix**: Implement email pre-classification to reject non-receipt emails before extraction

---

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Create EmailIntentAnalyzer.swift
- Email intent classification system
- Receipt detection algorithm with negative keywords
- Professional correspondence detection
- Marketing content filtering

### Phase 2: Update Extraction Pipeline
- Integrate EmailIntentAnalyzer into IntelligentExtractionService
- Add email rejection logic
- Remove mandatory fake invoice generation

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- Test with both receipts and non-receipts
- Validate zero false positives
- Performance impact assessment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL ERRORS (12 Anticipated)

### Critical Errors (P0)
1. **Regex Performance Issues**: Complex regex patterns could cause UI freezing on large emails
2. **Memory Leaks**: String operations on large email content could consume excessive memory
3. **False Negative Classification**: Legitimate receipts might be incorrectly rejected
4. **Integration Failures**: EmailIntentAnalyzer might break existing extraction flow
5. **Thread Safety Issues**: Concurrent email processing might cause race conditions

### Medium Errors (P1)
6. **Encoding Issues**: Special characters in emails might break regex matching
7. **Case Sensitivity Problems**: Inconsistent pattern matching across email formats
8. **Domain Matching Errors**: False positives from subdomains of legitimate merchants
9. **Content Length Issues**: Very long receipts might be incorrectly classified as correspondence

### Low Errors (P2)
10. **Logging Overload**: Excessive NSLog output might impact performance
11. **Pattern Maintenance**: Regex patterns might become outdated as email formats change
12. **Edge Case Handling**: Unusual email formats might not fit classification rules
