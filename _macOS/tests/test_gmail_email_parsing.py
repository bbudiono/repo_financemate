Gmail Email Parsing E2E Test - Multi-Merchant Transaction Extraction Validation

This test validates the Gmail transaction extraction functionality using real email samples from:
1. ShopBack cashback emails (multi-purchase consolidation)
2. Afterpay BNPL payments (semantic merchant extraction)
3. Woolworths grocery receipts (category + loyalty program)
4. Uber Eats orders (semantic restaurant extraction)
5. Government payments (defence.gov.au domain handling)

REAL DATA TEST: Uses actual email content from gmail_debug directory
VALIDATION FOCUS: Correct parsing across diverse Australian email formats
