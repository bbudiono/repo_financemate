## TEST RESULTS - RED PHASE (Expected Failures)

```
Total Tests: 8
Passed: 0
Failed: 8
Errors: 0
Duration: 0.002s

Breakdown:
❌ VoiceOver Labels: FAIL (2 views missing labels)
❌ Keyboard Navigation: FAIL (3 features missing)

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Phase Breakdown (Atomic TDD)

**Tier 1 - CRITICAL (VoiceOver Labels)**
- Files: DashboardView.swift, SettingsView.swift
- Effort: ~4 hours
- Test: `test_voiceover_labels()`
- Success: All 5 views have labels + hints

**Tier 2 - CRITICAL (Keyboard Navigation)**
- Files: ContentView.swift, TransactionsView.swift
- Effort: ~6 hours
- Test: `test_keyboard_navigation()`
- Success: All views keyboard-navigable

**Tier 3 - HIGH (Keyboard Shortcuts)**
- Files: ContentView.swift
- Effort: ~2 hours
- Test: `test_keyboard_shortcuts()`
- Success: Cmd+N, Cmd+F, Cmd+1-4 working

**Tier 4 - MEDIUM (Color Contrast)**
- Files: UnifiedThemeSystem.swift (create/update)
- Effort: ~3 hours
- Test: `test_color_contrast_ratios()`
- Success: All colors meet 4.5:1 AA standard

**Tier 5 - HIGH (Focus Management)**
- Files: ContentView.swift, all views
- Effort: ~5 hours
- Test: `test_focus_management()`
- Success: Clear focus indicators on all elements

**Tier 6 - MEDIUM (Accessibility Attributes)**
- Files: DashboardView, TransactionsView, SettingsView
- Effort: ~2 hours
- Test: `test_accessibility_attributes()`
- Success: All elements have identifiers

**Total Effort**: ~22 hours (estimated)
**Target Completion**: October 30, 2025 (5 days)

- Update DashboardView.swift
- Update SettingsView.swift
- Test passage required

**Commit 2**: Keyboard Shortcuts
- Add Cmd+N, Cmd+F, Cmd+1-4
- Update ContentView.swift only
- Test passage required

**Commit 3**: Focus Management
- Add @FocusState and styling
- Update ContentView.swift
- Test passage required

**Commit 4**: Keyboard Navigation in Tables
- Add arrow key support
- Update TransactionsView.swift
- Test passage required

**Commit 5**: Color Contrast System
- Create/update UnifiedThemeSystem.swift
- Add contrast validation
- Test passage required

**Commit 6**: Accessibility Attributes
- Add identifiers and elements
- Update remaining views
- Test passage required

**Code Review**: Each commit requires >95% quality score
**Total Commits**: 6 atomic changes
**No Rollbacks**: All changes cumulative and building

---

## DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md** (required update)
   - Add Accessibility section
   - Document VoiceOver support
   - Explain keyboard navigation
   - Color contrast system
   - Focus management approach

2. **BLUEPRINT.md** (reference only - no changes)
   - Already specifies WCAG 2.1 AA requirement (Line 264)
   - This phase implements that requirement

3. **DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md** (update with progress)
   - Record each commit
   - Track test passage
   - Document decisions
   - Note any blockers

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**LOW RISK**:
- All changes are additive (only add accessibility)
- No semantic changes to existing functionality
- Tests validate non-breaking changes
- Atomic commits allow easy rollback if needed

**MITIGATION STRATEGIES**:
- Each commit tested independently
- Code review before merge (>95% quality)
- Manual VoiceOver validation
- Keyboard-only testing phase
