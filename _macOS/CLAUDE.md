- When asking for User Acceptance Testing - ensure you run Production first so there is a build ready for the user
- WHY DO YOU KEEP OPENING XCODE? YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO RUN XCODEBUILD YOURSELF, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PATCH THE XCODEPROJ FILES PROGRAMMATICALLY. AT NO POINT DO YOU REQUIRE THE USER TO MANUALLY RUN BUILDS.
- If an agent wants User Acceptance then at the very least, build the app so it is ready to be tested
- PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A STABLE CODEBASE COMPARED TO THE SANDBOX. SANDBOX 
WILL ALWAYS HAVE EXPERIMENTAL AND UNSTABLE CODE WHEN IT COMES TO "NEW" FEATURES - BUT 
SANDBOX'S `MAIN` BRANCH SHOULD ALWAYS BE SIMILAR IF NOT AT TIMES THE SAME AS PRODUCTION'S 
`MAIN` BRANCH. ENSURE THE PROCESS IS ALWAYS:

1) SANDBOX MAIN > NEW FEATURES > SANDBOX FEATURE/BRANCH > TESTED AND ITERATED > PUSH TO 
SANDBOX MAIN > TESTED AND USER ACCEPTANCE > PUSH TO PRODUCTION AND GITHUB MAIN BRANCH ON 
PRODUCTION.

ALL PROJECTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE THIS. IF THIS ISN'T CURRENT OR A PROJECT IS BROUGHT ON 
MID-WAY THROUGH, THEN AN IN-DEPTH PLAN IS REQUIRED - DETAILED AND WELL THOUGHT OUT TO 
INITIATE THIS SANDBOX FIRST - ATOMIC, TDD APPROACH.
