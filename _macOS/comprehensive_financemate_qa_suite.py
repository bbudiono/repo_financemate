                "Build your emergency fund first before aggressive investing. Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account. This provides financial security for job loss or unexpected expenses. Once you have adequate emergency savings, then focus on investing for long-term goals.

Deductible expenses include loan interest, property management fees, maintenance, depreciation, and insurance. The net loss reduces your taxable income, potentially providing tax refunds.

Non-concessional (after-tax) contributions capped at $110,000 annually, not taxed if within limits. Total superannuation balance must be under $1.9 million to make non-concessional contributions.

Australian shares provide franking credit benefits, international shares offer diversification. Consider: 1) Salary sacrificing to maximize concessional contributions, 2) Regular rebalancing, 3) Lower-cost index funds or ETFs, 4) Gradually shifting to more conservative allocation as retirement approaches, 5) Insurance through super, 6) Regular strategy reviews.",
