- Bundle ID: com.ablankcanvas.financemate
- Code Signing: SUCCESSFUL with runtime entitlements
```

**MOCK DATA COMPLIANCE**: Comprehensive scan confirmed no production violations
**COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE**: All components maintain modular design principles
**DEPLOYMENT READINESS**: Production build pipeline fully functional

## üîß TECHNICAL EXECUTION DETAILS

### üõ†Ô∏è ECOSYSTEM REPAIR SCRIPT DEPLOYMENT

**Tool Created**: `ecosystem_xcode_repair.py`
```
üîß ECOSYSTEM REPAIR: Adding missing views to Xcode project
‚úÖ Added PBXBuildFile entries
‚úÖ Added PBXFileReference entries  
‚úÖ Added files to Views group
‚úÖ Added files to Sources build phase
‚úÖ Created backup: FinanceMate.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj.backup

- EmailConnectorService explicitly rejects mock credentials
- No mock data pathways in production code

### ‚úÖ BUILD VERIFICATION WITH COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING

**REQUIREMENT**: "Build verification with comprehensive logging"

**DELIVERED**: Complete audit trail including:
- Clean build process logs
- Ecosystem repair execution logs
- Production build success confirmation
- Apple Developer certificate validation
- Code signing and entitlements verification
