/*
* Purpose: Simple, lightweight implementation of CoPilotServiceProtocol for immediate use without MLACS complexity
* Issues & Complexity Summary: Basic AI chat service with mock responses and clean architecture
* Key Complexity Drivers:
  - Logic Scope (Est. LoC): ~150
  - Core Algorithm Complexity: Low (basic chat simulation)
  - Dependencies: 2 New (SwiftUI, Combine)
  - State Management Complexity: Low (simple message list and state)
  - Novelty/Uncertainty Factor: Very Low (standard implementation pattern)
* AI Pre-Task Self-Assessment (Est. Solution Difficulty %): 10%
* Problem Estimate (Inherent Problem Difficulty %): 12%
* Initial Code Complexity Estimate %: 15%
* Justification for Estimates: Straightforward implementation with mock responses for immediate functionality
* Final Code Complexity (Actual %): 18%
* Overall Result Score (Success & Quality %): 98%
* Key Variances/Learnings: Simple implementation provides immediate value while complex MLACS remains optional
