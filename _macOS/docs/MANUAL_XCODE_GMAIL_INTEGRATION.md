**Date**: 2025-08-10  
**Status**: 🔧 **MANUAL INTEGRATION REQUIRED**  
**Purpose**: Add Gmail connector files to Xcode project manually  

---

## 🎯 **MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED**

The automated integration encountered path issues. Please follow these manual steps:

### **Step 1: Open Xcode Project**
1. Open `FinanceMate.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Ensure you can see the project navigator on the left

### **Step 2: Add GmailAPIService.swift**
1. Right-click on the **"Services"** group in project navigator
2. Select **"Add Files to FinanceMate..."**
3. Navigate to: `FinanceMate/Services/GmailAPIService.swift`
4. Click **"Add"**
5. Verify the file appears in the Services group

### **Step 3: Add ExpenseTableView.swift**
1. Right-click on the **"Views"** group in project navigator  
2. Select **"Add Files to FinanceMate..."**
3. Navigate to: `FinanceMate/Views/ExpenseTableView.swift`
4. Click **"Add"**
5. Verify the file appears in the Views group

### **Step 4: Verify Integration**
1. Build the project (⌘+B)
2. Verify both files compile without errors
3. Check that the "Email Receipts" tab appears in the app

## 🔧 **FILE LOCATIONS**

The Gmail connector files are located at:

```
FinanceMate/
├── Services/
│   └── GmailAPIService.swift        ← Add this to Services group
├── Views/
│   └── ExpenseTableView.swift       ← Add this to Views group
└── FinanceMate/
    └── ContentView.swift            ← Already updated with Email Receipts tab
```

---

## 🧪 **TESTING AFTER INTEGRATION**

Once files are added to Xcode:

1. **Build Verification**: Project should compile successfully
2. **Tab Navigation**: "Email Receipts" tab should appear
3. **Gmail Authentication**: Should prompt for Gmail OAuth when clicked
4. **Receipt Processing**: Should scan and display expenses from Gmail

---

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Build Errors**
- Ensure both files are added to the main target (FinanceMate)
- Check that import statements are correct
- Verify file membership in target settings

### **Missing Tab**
- Ensure ContentView.swift includes the ExpenseTableView tab
- Check that the tab is properly configured in TabView

### **OAuth Issues**
- Ensure ProductionConfig.swift has valid Gmail client ID
- Check that Google Cloud Console is properly configured

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

✅ **Integration Complete When:**
- Project builds successfully without errors
- "Email Receipts" tab visible in app navigation
- Gmail authentication flow works correctly
- Expense table displays real receipt data

---

**⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Open Xcode and manually add the two Gmail connector files to complete the integration.**
