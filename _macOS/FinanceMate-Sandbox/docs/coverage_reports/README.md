## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

**Check Coverage Status:**
```bash
cd _macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox
./enforce_coverage.sh
```

**Generate Fresh Analysis:**
```bash
python3 docs/coverage_reports/comprehensive_coverage_analysis.py
```

**Review Key Reports:**
- Start with: `AUDIT_COVERAGE_FINAL_REPORT.md`
- Implementation: `QUALITY_GATE_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`
- Latest data: `comprehensive_coverage_[timestamp].md`

### For CI/CD Integration

**Build Pipeline Integration:**
```yaml
- name: Enforce Coverage Quality Gate
  run: |
    cd _macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox
    ./enforce_coverage.sh
  fail-fast: true
```

### For Quality Assurance

**Regular Monitoring:**
- Run weekly coverage analysis
- Track coverage trends over time
- Validate quality gate enforcement
- Review remediation progress
