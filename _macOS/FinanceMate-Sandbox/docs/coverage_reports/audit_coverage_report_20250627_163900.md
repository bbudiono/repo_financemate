## Quality Gate Assessment

❌ **QUALITY GATE: FAILED**

1 critical file(s) below the 80% coverage threshold.

### Required Actions
1. Increase test coverage for failing files
2. Focus on critical business logic paths
3. Add edge case and error handling tests
4. Review and improve testability of code

### Recommended Approach
- **Immediate:** Target files with lowest coverage first
- **Short-term:** Achieve 80%+ for all critical files
- **Long-term:** Establish coverage monitoring and enforcement


## Technical Implementation

### Coverage Collection Method
- **Build System:** Xcode with native coverage collection
- **Analysis:** File-based metrics and estimation
- **Reporting:** Automated markdown generation
- **Enforcement:** Integrated quality gate validation

### Coverage Improvement Strategy
1. **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual function testing
2. **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions  
3. **UI Tests:** Verify user interface flows
4. **Edge Cases:** Test error conditions and boundaries

### Tools and Integration
- **Xcode:** Native code coverage collection
- **CI/CD:** Quality gate enforcement in build pipeline
- **Reporting:** Automated coverage trend analysis
- **Monitoring:** Regular coverage health checks
