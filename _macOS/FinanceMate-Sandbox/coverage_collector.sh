| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|

| **Overall Status** | $OVERALL_STATUS $([ "$OVERALL_STATUS" = "PASS" ] && echo "✅" || echo "❌") |

## Quality Gate Assessment

EOF

if [ "$OVERALL_STATUS" = "PASS" ]; then
    cat >> "$COVERAGE_REPORT" << EOF
✅ **QUALITY GATE: PASSED**

All critical files meet or exceed the 80% coverage requirement.

### Next Steps
1. Maintain current coverage levels
2. Add coverage monitoring to CI/CD pipeline  
3. Regular coverage reviews in code reviews

EOF
else
    FAILED_COUNT=$((TOTAL_FILES - PASSING_FILES))
    cat >> "$COVERAGE_REPORT" << EOF
❌ **QUALITY GATE: FAILED**

$FAILED_COUNT critical file(s) below the 80% coverage threshold.

### Required Actions
1. Increase test coverage for failing files
2. Focus on critical business logic paths
3. Add edge case and error handling tests
4. Review and improve testability of code

### Recommended Approach
- **Immediate:** Target files with lowest coverage first
- **Short-term:** Achieve 80%+ for all critical files
- **Long-term:** Establish coverage monitoring and enforcement

EOF
fi

cat >> "$COVERAGE_REPORT" << EOF

## Technical Implementation

### Coverage Collection Method
- **Build System:** Xcode with native coverage collection
- **Analysis:** File-based metrics and estimation
- **Reporting:** Automated markdown generation
- **Enforcement:** Integrated quality gate validation

### Coverage Improvement Strategy
1. **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual function testing
2. **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions  
3. **UI Tests:** Verify user interface flows
4. **Edge Cases:** Test error conditions and boundaries

### Tools and Integration
- **Xcode:** Native code coverage collection
- **CI/CD:** Quality gate enforcement in build pipeline
- **Reporting:** Automated coverage trend analysis
- **Monitoring:** Regular coverage health checks

# FinanceMate Code Coverage Setup Guide

## Quick Start

1. **Collect Coverage Data**
   \`\`\`bash
   ./coverage_collector.sh
   \`\`\`

2. **Enforce Quality Gate**
   \`\`\`bash  
   ./enforce_coverage.sh
   \`\`\`

## Critical Files (80%+ Required)

$(printf "- %s\n" "${CRITICAL_FILES[@]}")

## Reports Location

- Coverage reports: \`docs/coverage_reports/\`
- Latest analysis: \`audit_coverage_report_TIMESTAMP.md\`
- Build logs: \`test_execution_TIMESTAMP.log\`

## Integration

Add to your build process:
\`\`\`bash
# Run tests with coverage
./coverage_collector.sh

# Enforce quality gate
./enforce_coverage.sh || exit 1
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

- **No tests running:** Check test scheme configuration
- **Build failures:** Verify code signing settings
- **Low coverage:** Add unit tests for critical business logic
