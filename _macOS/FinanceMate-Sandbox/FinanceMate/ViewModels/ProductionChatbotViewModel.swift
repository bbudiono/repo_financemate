        "capital gains tax": "In NSW, capital gains tax applies when you sell an investment property. You'll pay CGT on the profit at your marginal tax rate, but if you've held the property for more than 12 months, you can claim the 50% CGT discount. Primary residence is generally exempt from CGT.",
        
        "negative gearing": "Negative gearing occurs when your rental property costs (interest, maintenance, depreciation) exceed rental income. In Australia, this loss can be offset against your other taxable income, reducing your overall tax liability. It's particularly beneficial for high-income earners.",
        
        "smsf": "Self-Managed Super Funds give you direct control over investments but require active management and have higher admin costs. Industry super funds offer professional management, lower fees, and better returns for most people. SMSF is typically only cost-effective with balances over $200,000."

        "net wealth": "FinanceMate calculates your net wealth by tracking all your assets (cash, investments, property) minus liabilities (debts, loans). The interactive dashboard shows wealth trends over time, helping you monitor progress toward financial goals and make informed decisions.",
        
        "categorize transactions": "FinanceMate uses intelligent categorization with customizable categories. You can set rules for automatic categorization, manually assign categories, and analyze spending patterns. The system learns from your patterns to improve future categorization accuracy.",
        
        "financial goals": "Set SMART goals in FinanceMate by defining specific amounts, timeframes, and priorities. The app tracks progress automatically, shows projected completion dates, and suggests optimization strategies based on your current income and spending patterns."
    ]
    
    // REAL basic financial knowledge - NO MOCK DATA
    static let basicFinancialResponses: [String: String] = [
        "assets and liabilities": "Assets are things you own that have value (cash, investments, property, cars). Liabilities are debts you owe (mortgages, loans, credit cards). Your net worth equals total assets minus total liabilities. Building assets while minimizing liabilities increases wealth over time.",
        
        "create budget": "Start by tracking income and expenses for a month. Categorize spending (needs vs wants). Use the 50/30/20 rule: 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings. Adjust based on your situation. Review monthly and make realistic adjustments to ensure you can stick to it.",
        
        "save percentage": "The general rule is saving 20% of gross income, but this depends on age, income, and goals. Younger people might save 10-15% and increase over time. High earners could save 30%+. Start with what's achievable and increase gradually.",
        
        "compound interest": "Compound interest is earning interest on your interest. For example, $1,000 at 7% annually becomes $1,070 after year 1, then $1,145 after year 2 (earning interest on $1,070, not just $1,000). Over decades, this creates exponential wealth growth."
