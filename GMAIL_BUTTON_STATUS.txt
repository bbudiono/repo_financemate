GMAIL BUTTON FUNCTIONAL TESTING - FINAL STATUS
===============================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
----------------
Gmail "Connect" button opens Safari but goes to homepage (favorites://) instead of OAuth URL.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID"] returns nil
→ if-let fails silently
→ NSWorkspace.shared.open(url) never called
→ Safari opens without URL argument → defaults to homepage

WHY CLIENT_ID IS NIL:
--------------------
macOS GUI apps launched via `open` command don't inherit shell environment variables.
.env file exists but app has no way to read it when launched standalone.

SOLUTIONS ATTEMPTED:
-------------------
1. ❌ EnvironmentLoader.swift - loads .env at app init (created but path finding failed)
2. ❌ EnvFileReader.swift - reads .env from bundle Resources (created but not used due to hook blocks)
3. ✅ Xcode scheme environment variables (configured OAuth creds in scheme)

CURRENT STATE:
-------------
✅ Code: Button logic correct, OAuth helper works
✅ Xcode scheme: Environment variables configured
❌ Standalone launch: Broken (no env var injection)

WORKAROUND FOR USER:
-------------------
**Option A - Run from Xcode (WORKS):**
1. Open Xcode
2. Press ⌘R (Run)
3. App launches WITH environment variables from scheme
4. Gmail button will work

**Option B - Finish EnvFileReader Integration (30 min):**
1. Bypass sitemap hook OR create sitemap
2. Edit GmailView.swift to use EnvFileReader.getGoogleClientID()
3. Rebuild
4. Standalone app will work

**Option C - Manual OAuth (CURRENT):**
User already got authorization code: 4/1AVGzR1BANu2iZ05oTuIXjtj_u_a8XlRmoCx_Q25jMC1KOHnX3twTPsatH4E
Can paste this manually to test OAuth exchange.

RECOMMENDATION:
--------------
Run app from Xcode (⌘R) to test Gmail functionality properly.
Standalone .env loading can be fixed post-MVP.
