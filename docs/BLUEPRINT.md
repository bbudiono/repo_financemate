## Overview
FinanceMate is a macOS application that allows users to drag and drop or upload images, screenshots, PDFs, and other documents (such as invoices and dockets). The app uses OCR to extract line items from these documents and maps them to user-defined spreadsheet columns for tax and accounting purposes. It supports integration with Office365 Excel Online and Google Sheets (SSO/OAuth), and will support email integration (Gmail) for automatic invoice/receipt extraction in the future.

  - Tagging, sharing, linked spreadsheets
  - Gmail integration (auto-extract)
  - Analytics, dashboard, tax handling
  - Invoicing (optional)
  - Financial year filters and reporting
- **Production Phase**
  - Cross-platform (iOS/iPadOS/web)
  - Advanced integrations (bank feeds, Stripe, etc.)
  - Advanced reporting, analytics, performance
  - UI polish, scalability, bug fixes

## Logical Dependency Chain
- Foundation: Local file import, OCR, spreadsheet mapping
- Next: UI for review/edit, column customization
- Then: Export, cloud sync (Google Sheets/Office365)

## OCR Testing Resources
The project includes a standard test data directory at `docs/TestData/` containing various PDF invoice and receipt samples. This directory is critical for OCR development and testing and must not be deleted. All OCR functionality and automated tests should utilize these files as reference documents to ensure consistent behavior and quality verification across the application.

## Spreadsheet Column Customization Requirements

FinanceMate allows users to fully customize the columns in their spreadsheet view. The following requirements define the scope for this feature:

- Users can add new columns, specifying a name and type (text, currency, date, number).
- Users can remove existing columns.
- Users can rename columns.
- Users can reorder columns via drag-and-drop or up/down controls.
- Users can select the type for each column (text, currency, date, number).
- The UI must provide an intuitive interface for all customization actions.
- All changes are persisted per user (using UserDefaults or local file storage for now).
- The system must validate column names (no duplicates, not empty).
- The default set of columns should be provided for new users, but fully editable.
