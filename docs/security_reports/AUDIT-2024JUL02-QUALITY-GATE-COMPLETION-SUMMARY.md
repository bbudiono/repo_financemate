## Critical Security Notes for Production

### 1. Sign in with Apple Configuration
```
Current Status: Temporarily disabled for development builds
Action Required: Re-enable for TestFlight/App Store submission
Configuration: Uncomment entitlement in production FinanceMate.entitlements
Timing: Before final production deployment
```

Production: Requires explicit provisioning profile with Sign in with Apple capability
Distribution: Apple Distribution certificate required for App Store submission
```

### 3. Security Validation Workflow
```
Pre-Deployment Checklist:
├── Run scripts/validate_security_entitlements.sh
├── Verify 100% security compliance score
├── Enable Sign in with Apple in production entitlements
├── Validate proper provisioning profile
└── Confirm code signing for distribution
```
