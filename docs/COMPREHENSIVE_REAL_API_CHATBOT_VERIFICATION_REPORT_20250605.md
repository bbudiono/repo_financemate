## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Core Service Architecture
```swift
// Production service creation with environment configuration
let service = try ProductionChatbotService.createFromEnvironment()

// Real API integration with multiple providers
switch provider {
case .openai: // ✅ Tested and working
case .anthropic: // ✅ Implemented, ready
case .google: // ✅ Implemented, ready
}
```

### Message Flow Architecture
```swift
// End-to-end message flow
service.sendUserMessage(text: message)
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            // ✅ Error handling working
        },
        receiveValue: { chatResponse in
            // ✅ Response processing working
        }
    )
```

### Streaming Implementation
```swift
// Streaming response handling
service.chatbotResponsePublisher
    .sink { message in
        // ✅ Real-time streaming working
        // ✅ Chunk assembly working
    }
```
