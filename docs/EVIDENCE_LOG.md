| Evidence ID | Finding                                                                        | Location                                                                           | Status    | Notes                                                                                             |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| COMP-001    | Project does not compile.                                                      | `FinanceMate-Sandbox` Target                                                       | FAILED    | Build fails with multiple errors in `FinanceMateAgents.swift`.                                    |
| TEST-001    | E2E test suite cannot be executed.                                             | `run_sandbox_tests.sh`                                                             | BLOCKED   | Blocked by COMP-001.                                                                              |
| ARCH-001    | Duplicated type definition for `AgentDocumentMetadata`.                        | `_macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/FinanceMate-Sandbox/Services/MLACS/FinanceMateAgents.swift` | FAILED    | Creates ambiguity and risk of synchronization bugs. Indicates lack of architectural control.    |
| ARCH-002    | Duplicated type definition for `AgentPerformanceMetrics`.                      | `_macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/FinanceMate-Sandbox/Services/MLACS/FinanceMateAgents.swift` | FAILED    | Creates ambiguity and risk of synchronization bugs. Indicates lack of architectural control.    |
| ARCH-003    | Sandbox target has no dependency on the main application target.               | `_macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/FinanceMate-Sandbox.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`        | FAILED    | **Root cause of ARCH-001 and ARCH-002.** The sandbox cannot see production code, leading to file duplication instead of linking. |
| SEC-003     | Dangerously Permissive Sandbox Entitlements                                  | `_macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/FinanceMate-Sandbox/FinanceMate-Sandbox.entitlements` | FAILED    | Sandbox is enabled but rendered useless by exceptions like `get-task-allow` and `disable-library-validation`, creating critical security vulnerabilities. |
| SEC-004     | Disconnected Security Models: Sandbox vs. Production                         | `FinanceMate-Sandbox.entitlements` vs. `FinanceMate.entitlements`                | FAILED    | The sandbox's permissive security model does not match the restrictive production model, guaranteeing that sandbox testing will not reflect production behavior. |
| RULE-001    | Auditor (self) was not compliant with `.cursorrules` file generation.          | `AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `EVIDENCE_LOG.md`                                               | FAILED    | Procedural failure by the auditor. Now corrected.                                                 |
