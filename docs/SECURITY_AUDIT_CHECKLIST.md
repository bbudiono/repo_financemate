## üö® **CRITICAL SECURITY VIOLATIONS**

### **ZERO TOLERANCE VIOLATIONS (Immediate Action Required)**

#### **üî¥ P0 CRITICAL**
- **Real API keys in code** ‚Üí Immediate git history cleanup + key rotation
- **Production credentials exposed** ‚Üí Emergency credential rotation
- **Database credentials in plain text** ‚Üí Immediate security incident response
- **Private keys or certificates committed** ‚Üí Certificate revocation + reissuance

#### **üü° P1 HIGH**
- **Missing input validation** ‚Üí Immediate code review and remediation
- **Insecure authentication** ‚Üí Security architecture review
- **Vulnerable dependencies** ‚Üí Emergency patching
- **Missing encryption** ‚Üí Data protection implementation

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **SECURITY REMEDIATION PROCEDURES**

### **Immediate Response (P0)**
1. **Stop all deployments** - Prevent insecure code from reaching production
2. **Rotate compromised credentials** - Generate new API keys/secrets immediately
3. **Clean git history** - Use `git-filter-repo` or BFG to remove secrets
4. **Security incident documentation** - Record details for post-mortem analysis

### **Rapid Response (P1)**
1. **Create security fix branch** - Isolate security fixes
2. **Implement security controls** - Add missing security measures
3. **Security validation testing** - Comprehensive security testing
4. **Coordinated deployment** - Secure rollout with monitoring

---

## üìä **SECURITY METRICS & MONITORING**

### **Key Security Indicators**

- [ ] **Vulnerability response time** - <24 hours for P0, <72 hours for P1
- [ ] **Security scan coverage** - 100% of commits scanned
- [ ] **Compliance validation** - Regular audit compliance checks

### **Security Reporting**
- [ ] **Daily security scans** - Automated vulnerability detection
- [ ] **Weekly security reports** - Comprehensive security status
- [ ] **Monthly security reviews** - Architecture and process evaluation
- [ ] **Quarterly security audits** - Third-party security validation
