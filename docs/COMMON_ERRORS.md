**Version:** 1.0.0-RC1 (Production Release Candidate)
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-05
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY - Comprehensive Error Guide

---

## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Error Status: âœ… STABLE (Production Ready)
The FinanceMate application has achieved a **stable, production-ready state** with robust error handling and no known critical runtime errors. All common error patterns identified during development have been addressed with comprehensive solutions, including input validation, Core Data error handling, and UI state management.

### Key Error Handling Achievements
- âœ… **Zero Critical Errors**: No known critical or high-priority runtime errors
- âœ… **Robust Core Data Handling**: Comprehensive error management for database operations
- âœ… **Input Validation**: Secure and user-friendly form validation
- âœ… **UI State Management**: Clear error messaging and state recovery
- âœ… **Proactive Error Prevention**: Codebase designed to prevent common runtime issues

---

## 1. ERROR CATEGORIES

This document covers common **runtime and development errors**, distinct from the build failures documented in `docs/BUILD_FAILURES.md`.

- **Core Data Errors**: Issues related to database operations (fetch, save, delete).
- **UI & State Management Errors**: Problems with SwiftUI views, data binding, and state synchronization.
- **Input Validation Errors**: Errors from user input in forms and settings.
- **Environment & Configuration Errors**: Issues related to Xcode, simulator, or project setup.

---

## 2. CORE DATA ERRORS

### 2.1. Failed to Save Context

- **Error Message**: `Error saving context: The operation couldn't be completed.`
- **Cause**: An issue occurred while trying to save changes to the Core Data persistent store, often due to validation errors or underlying store issues.
- **Solution**:
    1. **Implement `do-catch` blocks** around all `context.save()` calls to gracefully handle exceptions.
    2. **Log detailed error information** to the console for debugging (`error.localizedDescription`).
    3. **Provide user-facing feedback**, such as an alert, indicating that the data could not be saved.
    4. **Ensure data validation** is performed *before* attempting to save to prevent validation-related save failures.
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED. All Core Data save operations are wrapped in `do-catch` blocks with user-facing alerts.

### 2.2. Fetch Request Failure

- **Error Message**: `Could not fetch transactions: The fetch request's entity ... could not be found.`
- **Cause**: The fetch request is executed with an incorrect entity name or the Core Data model is not properly loaded.
- **Solution**:
    1. **Verify entity names** used in `NSFetchRequest` match the entity names defined in the programmatic Core Data model.
    2. **Ensure the `PersistenceController`** is correctly initialized and the `NSManagedObjectContext` is passed through the environment.
    3. **Implement error handling** for fetch requests to prevent crashes and provide fallback UI.
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED. All fetch requests use correct entity names and include error handling.

### 2.3. Data Inconsistency

- **Symptom**: UI does not update correctly after data changes, or displays stale data.
- **Cause**: Issues with `@FetchRequest` property wrapper, incorrect use of `NSManagedObjectContext`, or background context synchronization problems.
- **Solution**:
    1. **Use `@FetchRequest`** as the primary mechanism for fetching and displaying data in SwiftUI views to ensure automatic UI updates.
    2. **Perform all UI-related data operations** on the main context (`viewContext`).
    3. **Ensure a single source of truth** for the `PersistenceController` and its context throughout the application.
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED. The application consistently uses `@FetchRequest` and the main `viewContext` for all UI operations.

## 3. UI & STATE MANAGEMENT ERRORS

### 3.1. "Purple" SwiftUI Warnings

- **Warning Message**: `Publishing changes from background threads is not allowed`
- **Cause**: An `@Published` property in a ViewModel is being updated from a background thread, which is not permitted.
- **Solution**:
    1. **Wrap all ViewModel property updates** in `await MainActor.run` or ensure the ViewModel method is marked with `@MainActor`.
    2. **Use `@MainActor`** on ViewModel classes to ensure all methods and properties are accessed on the main thread by default.
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED. All ViewModels are marked with `@MainActor` to enforce main-thread updates.

### 3.2. Data Not Updating in View

- **Symptom**: A view does not reflect the latest data from a ViewModel or Core Data.
- **Cause**: Missing `@ObservedObject` or `@StateObject` property wrappers, or incorrect data binding.
- **Solution**:
    1. **Use `@StateObject`** to create and initialize the primary instance of a ViewModel in a view.
    2. **Use `@ObservedObject`** to reference an existing ViewModel instance that is passed down the view hierarchy.
    3. **Ensure properties in ViewModels** that should trigger UI updates are marked with `@Published`.
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED. Correct use of `@StateObject` and `@ObservedObject` is implemented across all views.

---

## 4. INPUT VALIDATION ERRORS

### 4.1. Invalid Transaction Amount

- **Symptom**: User can enter non-numeric or negative values for a transaction amount.
- **Cause**: Lack of input validation on the transaction entry form.
- **Solution**:
    1. **Use a `NumberFormatter`** to restrict input to valid decimal numbers.
    2. **Implement client-side validation logic** in the `TransactionsViewModel` to check for positive, non-zero amounts before enabling the "Save" button.
    3. **Display clear, user-friendly error messages** next to the input field indicating the validation rule that failed.
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED. The transaction form includes comprehensive input validation with real-time feedback.

---

## 5. ENVIRONMENT & CONFIGURATION ERRORS

### 5.1. Simulator or Preview Failures

- **Symptom**: Xcode Previews crash or the app fails to launch in the simulator.
- **Cause**: Often related to the `PersistenceController` not being properly configured for in-memory storage for previews or tests.
- **Solution**:
    1. **Provide an in-memory `PersistenceController`** instance specifically for previews.
```swift
    #if DEBUG
    static var preview: PersistenceController = {
        let result = PersistenceController(inMemory: true)
        // ... add mock data
        return result
    }()
    #endif
    ```
    2. **Inject the preview context** into the environment for SwiftUI previews.
```swift
    .environment(\.managedObjectContext, PersistenceController.preview.container.viewContext)
    ```
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED. All SwiftUI previews use an in-memory Core Data store with mock data for stability.

## 6. PROACTIVE ERROR PREVENTION

The FinanceMate codebase includes several strategies to prevent common errors proactively:

- **Robust ViewModels**: Centralize business logic and state management to prevent scattered and inconsistent code.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: A suite of 75+ tests helps catch regressions and validate error handling logic.
- **Clear Error Messaging**: User-facing alerts and inline messages provide clear guidance when errors occur.
- **Input Validation**: Prevent invalid data from entering the system at the source.
- **Stable Previews**: Ensure a smooth development experience with reliable SwiftUI previews.

**FinanceMate** is designed for stability and reliability, with comprehensive error handling and proactive prevention measures. This document serves as a guide to understanding and resolving common runtime issues.
