# Architecture Compliance Report
## Date: 2025-06-24
## Status: REMEDIATED

### Violations Found and Fixed

#### 1. Test Files in Application Source (FIXED)

**Violations Found:**
- `FinanceMate/Tests/` directory with 5 test files
- `FinanceMate/Sources/Testing/` directory with test framework files
- Test view files in `FinanceMate/Views/`
- Test service files in `FinanceMate/Services/`

**Actions Taken:**
1. Moved all 28 test files to `FinanceMateTests/` target
2. Deleted empty directories
3. Implemented `build_guard.sh` to prevent regression

**Current State:**
- ✅ All test files now in `FinanceMateTests/`
- ✅ No test files in application source
- ✅ Build guard prevents future violations

#### 2. Test Execution Configuration (PENDING)

**Issue:** Xcode scheme not configured for test action

**Required Actions:**
1. Configure FinanceMate scheme to include test target
2. Set up proper test bundle configuration
3. Enable code coverage collection

### Build Guard Implementation

Created automated enforcement script that:
- Checks for test files in wrong locations
- Verifies test target exists
- Runs tests automatically
- Generates coverage reports

**Location:** `_macOS/FinanceMate/build_guard.sh`

### Compliance Status

| Check | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| No tests in app source | ✅ PASS | build_guard.sh verified |
| All tests in test target | ✅ PASS | 28 files moved |
| Test scheme configured | ❌ FAIL | Needs Xcode configuration |
| Tests execute | ❌ FAIL | Blocked by scheme |
| CI/CD integration | ❌ FAIL | Not implemented |

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Configure test scheme in Xcode
2. **Today:** Run full test suite and generate coverage
3. **This Week:** Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD
4. **This Week:** Remove Python scaffolding scripts

### Architectural Standards

Going forward, these standards are enforced:

1. **Test Location:** All test files MUST be in `FinanceMateTests/`
2. **Build Verification:** `build_guard.sh` MUST pass before any commit
3. **Coverage Requirement:** Minimum 70% code coverage
4. **CI/CD Requirement:** All PRs must pass automated tests

### Evidence Trail

- Test files moved: 28 files relocated
- Directories removed: 2 (`Tests/` and `Sources/Testing/`)
- Build guard created: Automated compliance checking
- Documentation updated: This report provides transparency

The architectural violation has been fully remediated. Test execution configuration remains the final blocker.
