## 1. ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS

### 1.1. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

- **Pattern Description**: MVVM is the core architectural pattern used in FinanceMate. It cleanly separates the application's concerns into three distinct layers:
    - **Model**: The data layer, represented by the Core Data entities (`Transaction`, `Settings`).
    - **View**: The UI layer, composed of SwiftUI views that are responsible for presentation only.
    - **ViewModel**: The business logic layer, which acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It prepares data for display, handles user interactions, and performs business logic.

- **Implementation in FinanceMate**:
    - Each primary feature (Dashboard, Transactions, Settings) has a dedicated ViewModel (`DashboardViewModel`, `TransactionsViewModel`, `SettingsViewModel`).
    - ViewModels are `ObservableObject` classes, and their properties are marked with `@Published` to automatically trigger UI updates.
    - Views observe ViewModels using `@StateObject` (for creation) or `@ObservedObject` (for referencing).
    - All ViewModels are marked with `@MainActor` to ensure that UI-related updates are always performed on the main thread.

- **Benefits**:
    - **Testability**: Business logic is completely decoupled from the UI, allowing for comprehensive unit testing of ViewModels.
    - **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand, modify, and extend.
    - **Scalability**: New features can be added by creating new sets of Model-View-ViewModel components without impacting existing code.

- **Example Snippet (`DashboardView.swift`)**:
```swift
struct DashboardView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel: DashboardViewModel
    
    init(context: NSManagedObjectContext) {
        _viewModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: DashboardViewModel(context: context))
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Total Balance: \(viewModel.totalBalance)")
            // ... other UI components
        }
        .onAppear {
            viewModel.fetchDashboardData()
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. DATA PERSISTENCE PATTERNS

### 2.1. Programmatic Core Data Model

- **Pattern Description**: To avoid the fragility and potential build issues associated with `.xcdatamodeld` files (especially when using tools like XcodeGen), FinanceMate uses a **programmatic approach to define its Core Data model**. The `NSManagedObjectModel` is constructed in code rather than being loaded from a compiled file.

- **Implementation in FinanceMate**:
    - The `PersistenceController` class contains a static method, `managedObjectModel`, which programmatically creates `NSEntityDescription` and `NSAttributeDescription` objects for each entity.
    - This `NSManagedObjectModel` is then used to initialize the `NSPersistentContainer`.

- **Benefits**:
    - **Build Stability**: Eliminates a common source of build failures related to `.xcdatamodeld` file compilation or location.
    - **Flexibility**: The data model can be easily modified and versioned directly in code.
    - **Clarity**: The entire data model is defined in one clear, readable place.

- **Example Snippet (`PersistenceController.swift`)**:
```swift
static var managedObjectModel: NSManagedObjectModel {
    let model = NSManagedObjectModel()
        
    // Create Transaction Entity
    let transactionEntity = NSEntityDescription()
    transactionEntity.name = "Transaction"
    transactionEntity.managedObjectClassName = "Transaction"
    
    // Add attributes to Transaction Entity
    let idAttr = NSAttributeDescription()
    idAttr.name = "id"
    idAttr.attributeType = .uuidAttributeType
    // ... add other attributes
    
    transactionEntity.properties = [idAttr, ...]
    
    model.entities = [transactionEntity]
    return model
}
```

## 3. UI/UX PATTERNS

### 3.1. Reusable Glassmorphism UI System

- **Pattern Description**: To ensure a consistent and high-quality visual appearance, FinanceMate uses a **reusable Glassmorphism design system** implemented as a `ViewModifier`. This allows the glass-like effect to be applied to any view with different style variations.

- **Implementation in FinanceMate**:
    - A `GlassmorphismModifier.swift` file defines the modifier.
    - It includes an `enum` for different styles (`primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `minimal`), each with its own background, blur, and shadow configuration.
    - Views can easily apply the effect using `.modifier(GlassmorphismModifier(.style))`.

- **Benefits**:
    - **Consistency**: Ensures a uniform look and feel across the entire application.
    - **Maintainability**: The design system can be updated in one central place, and the changes will propagate to all views.
    - **Readability**: Keeps the styling logic separate from the view's layout code.

- **Example Snippet**:
```swift
struct GlassmorphismModifier: ViewModifier {
    enum Style { case primary, secondary, accent, minimal }
    let style: Style
    
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        // ... implementation with background, blur, shadow, etc.
    }
}

// Usage in a view
Text("Hello, World!")
    .modifier(GlassmorphismModifier(.primary))
```

## 4. TESTING PATTERNS

### 4.1. TDD-Driven ViewModel Development

- **Pattern Description**: All ViewModel development in FinanceMate follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach. Tests are written *before* the implementation code to define the expected behavior clearly.

- **Implementation in FinanceMate**:
    1. A new test file is created for the ViewModel (e.g., `SettingsViewModelTests.swift`).
    2. A failing test is written for a specific piece of functionality (e.g., `testThemeChange()`).
    3. The implementation code is written in the ViewModel to make the test pass.
    4. The code is refactored while ensuring the test continues to pass.

- **Benefits**:
    - **High-Quality Code**: Results in well-designed, loosely coupled code that is easy to test.
    - **Regression Prevention**: A comprehensive test suite prevents future changes from breaking existing functionality.
    - **Clear Requirements**: Writing tests first forces a clear definition of what the code is supposed to do.

### 4.2. In-Memory Core Data for Previews and Tests

- **Pattern Description**: To ensure that SwiftUI Previews and unit/UI tests are fast, reliable, and isolated, an **in-memory Core Data store** is used. This prevents tests from interfering with each other or with the user's actual data.

- **Implementation in FinanceMate**:
    - The `PersistenceController` has a special initializer `init(inMemory: Bool)`.
    - A static `preview` instance is created for SwiftUI Previews, using the in-memory store and populated with mock data.
    - Test suites create their own in-memory `PersistenceController` instance in their `setUp()` method.

- **Benefits**:
    - **Test Isolation**: Each test runs in a clean, sandboxed data environment.
    - **Speed**: In-memory operations are significantly faster than disk-based operations.
    - **Stable Previews**: SwiftUI Previews are reliable and do not depend on the state of the on-disk database.
