## ðŸ“Š DETAILED EVIDENCE & VERIFICATION

### BUILD VERIFICATION LOGS
```
** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
Build completed successfully with Apple Developer Certificate:
- Signing Identity: "Apple Development: BERNHARD JOSHUA BUDIONO (ZK86L2658W)"
- Provisioning Profile: "Mac Team Provisioning Profile: com.ablankcanvas.financemate"
- Bundle ID: com.ablankcanvas.financemate
- Code Signing: SUCCESSFUL with runtime entitlements
```

### ECOSYSTEM REPAIR EVIDENCE
```
ðŸ”§ ECOSYSTEM REPAIR: Adding missing views to Xcode project
âœ… Added PBXBuildFile entries
âœ… Added PBXFileReference entries  
âœ… Added files to Views group
âœ… Added files to Sources build phase
âœ… Created backup: FinanceMate.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj.backup
ðŸŽ‰ ECOSYSTEM REPAIR COMPLETE: Xcode project structure restored
```

### MOCK DATA COMPLIANCE SCAN RESULTS
