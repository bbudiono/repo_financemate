## üîç **MANDATORY SECURITY VALIDATIONS**

### **Before ANY Code Changes**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Execute security validation
echo "Agent Security Check:"
echo "1. Does this change introduce any security risks? ‚úì/‚úó"
echo "2. Are all credentials properly secured? ‚úì/‚úó"
echo "3. Is input validation implemented? ‚úì/‚úó"
echo "4. Are security best practices followed? ‚úì/‚úó"
echo "5. Has security documentation been updated? ‚úì/‚úó"

# If ANY answer is ‚úó, STOP and address security issues first
```

### **Secret Detection Protocol**
```yaml
BEFORE_EVERY_COMMIT:
  automated_checks:
    - "Run ./scripts/security/pre_commit_security_scan.sh"

  manual_validation:
