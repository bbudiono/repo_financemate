# Task ID: 16
# Title: Reporting and Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement basic reporting for case status, time, and billing.
# Details:
Build reporting views for case status, time entries, and billing. Generate PDF or CSV reports. Use SwiftUI for visualization.

# Test Strategy:
Test report generation and data accuracy. Verify export formats.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Data Models for Reports [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the data structures needed for case status, time entries, and billing reports
### Details:
Create Swift structs or classes that conform to Identifiable and Codable protocols. Include properties for all required reporting fields such as case status categories, time entry details (date, duration, description, rate), and billing information (invoiced amounts, payment status). Implement computed properties for aggregated values like total hours or amounts.

## 2. Implement Report Data Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a service layer to fetch and process reporting data from the database
### Details:
Develop an ObservableObject class that manages report data retrieval and processing. Implement methods to query the database for case status, time entries, and billing information. Add filtering capabilities by date range, case type, and status. Include data aggregation functions for summaries and statistics.

## 3. Build SwiftUI Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create reusable SwiftUI views for data visualization in reports
### Details:
Develop custom SwiftUI views for charts, graphs, and tables. Implement bar charts for case status distribution, line charts for time tracking over periods, and tables for detailed billing information. Use SwiftUI's compositional approach to create modular, reusable visualization components that can be combined in different report types.

## 4. Create Report Generation Views [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the main reporting interface with filtering options and visualization display
### Details:
Implement the main reporting screens using SwiftUI. Create a tabbed interface for different report types (status, time, billing). Add date range pickers, status filters, and other relevant filtering controls. Integrate the visualization components from the previous subtask. Implement view state management using ObservableObject and Published properties to handle user interactions and data updates.

## 5. Implement Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add capability to export reports as PDF or CSV files
### Details:
Create an export service that can convert report data to PDF and CSV formats. For PDF generation, use UIGraphicsPDFRenderer or a third-party library to render SwiftUI views to PDF. For CSV export, implement proper data formatting and file creation. Add share functionality to allow users to save or send the generated reports via standard iOS sharing options.
