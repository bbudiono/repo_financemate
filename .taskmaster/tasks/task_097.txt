# Task ID: 97
# Title: Expand Product Feature Inbox into Actionable Level 5-6 Tasks with TDD Requirements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Decompose all product features listed in the latest user message into detailed, actionable Level 5-6 tasks, ensuring each includes explicit TDD/test requirements and aligns with project priorities and compliance standards.
# Details:
Review the latest user message to extract all listed product features. For each feature, break it down into granular Level 5-6 actionable tasks, ensuring that each task is specific, testable, and includes clear TDD/test requirements. Prioritize features related to SSO, UX/UI, and those critical to upcoming milestones. Cross-reference and synchronize the expanded tasks with docs/TASKS.MD and tasks/tasks.json to maintain consistency and traceability. Ensure all tasks adhere to .cursorrules for compliance, and document any ambiguities or dependencies. Maintain clear linkage between original features and resulting tasks for traceability and future audits.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that every product feature from the latest user message is represented by a set of Level 5-6 actionable tasks, each with explicit TDD/test requirements. Confirm that SSO, UX/UI, and milestone-critical features are prioritized in the breakdown. Check that all new tasks are accurately reflected in docs/TASKS.MD and tasks/tasks.json, and that .cursorrules compliance is documented. Review for completeness, traceability, and clarity, and validate that no feature or requirement is omitted.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extract and Prioritize Product Features from Latest User Message [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the latest user message to identify all listed product features. Prioritize features related to SSO, UX/UI, and those critical to upcoming milestones, ensuring alignment with project priorities.
### Details:
Carefully read the latest user message and create a comprehensive list of all product features mentioned. Use project documentation and milestone plans to determine which features are highest priority, especially those related to SSO and UX/UI. Document the prioritized list for traceability.

## 2. Decompose Each Feature into Level 5-6 Actionable Tasks [pending]
### Dependencies: 97.1
### Description: Break down each prioritized feature into granular, actionable Level 5-6 tasks, ensuring each task is specific, manageable, and aligned with the INVEST principle.
### Details:
For each feature, use techniques such as story splitting and component/page decomposition to create detailed tasks. Ensure each task is small enough for a single developer to implement and delivers clear user value. Reference designs, user roles, and stakeholder input as needed.

## 3. Define Explicit TDD/Test Requirements for Each Task [pending]
### Dependencies: 97.2
### Description: For every decomposed task, specify clear TDD/test requirements, including acceptance criteria and test cases to ensure testability and compliance.
### Details:
Attach explicit test requirements to each task, such as unit, integration, and acceptance tests. Use standard formats for acceptance criteria and ensure each requirement is measurable and verifiable. Consult .cursorrules and compliance standards for any additional test mandates.

## 4. Synchronize Expanded Tasks with Project Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 97.3
### Description: Update docs/TASKS.MD and tasks/tasks.json to reflect the newly decomposed tasks, maintaining traceability between original features and resulting tasks.
### Details:
For each new task, ensure it is added to both TASKS.MD and tasks/tasks.json with appropriate metadata, including links to the original feature and any dependencies. Maintain a mapping for future audits and traceability.

## 5. Review for Compliance, Ambiguities, and Set Status to Pending [pending]
### Dependencies: 97.4
### Description: Audit all tasks for compliance with .cursorrules, document any ambiguities or dependencies, and set the status of all subtasks to 'pending' for a clean project management slate.
### Details:
Review each task for adherence to compliance rules and flag any unclear requirements or dependencies for follow-up. Update the status of every subtask to 'pending' in all tracking systems, regardless of previous status.
