# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Review .cursorrules Section 6.4.1 for Comment Block Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine the .cursorrules file, specifically section 6.4.1, to identify the exact format and required fields (purpose, issues & complexity, ranking/rating, last updated) for the mandatory comment block.
### Details:
Open the .cursorrules file and carefully read section 6.4.1. Note the required structure, field order, and any formatting conventions for the mandatory comment block.

## 2. Draft the Mandatory Comment Block Content [pending]
### Dependencies: 69.1
### Description: Prepare the content for each required field (purpose, issues & complexity, ranking/rating, last updated) based on the script's functionality and current project context.
### Details:
Summarize the script's purpose, note any known issues or complexities, assign a ranking/rating as per .cursorrules, and set the 'last updated' date. Ensure clarity and completeness for each field.

## 3. Format the Comment Block for Shell Script Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 69.2
### Description: Convert the drafted comment block into a format suitable for shell scripts, using the appropriate comment syntax.
### Details:
Use the hash (#) at the start of each line to create a block comment, as this is the standard and most portable method for shell scripts[1][4]. Ensure the block is visually distinct and readable at the top of the script.

## 4. Insert the Comment Block at the Top of create_minimal_swiftui_app.sh [pending]
### Dependencies: 69.3
### Description: Add the formatted comment block to the very top of scripts/create_minimal_swiftui_app.sh, above any code or shebang line if required by .cursorrules.
### Details:
Open the script file and paste the comment block at the top. If .cursorrules specifies placement relative to the shebang (#!/bin/bash), follow those instructions precisely.

## 5. Validate Compliance and Commit Changes [pending]
### Dependencies: 69.4
### Description: Review the script to ensure the comment block meets all .cursorrules requirements, then commit the changes to version control.
### Details:
Perform a final check against .cursorrules section 6.4.1. Run any available linting or compliance tools. Commit the updated script with a descriptive commit message referencing the addition of the mandatory comment block.
