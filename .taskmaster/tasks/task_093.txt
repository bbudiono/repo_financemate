# Task ID: 93
# Title: Implement MVP Settings and About Us Pages
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the core Settings and About Us pages for the MVP, ensuring each is modular, accessible, and testable as standalone views.
# Details:
Create two distinct, navigable pages: (1) Settings, which should include sections for account preferences, notification options, and privacy controls (with placeholder toggles and editable fields as needed for MVP), and (2) About Us, which should display company information, mission statement, and contact details. Use existing design system components for consistency. Ensure both pages are responsive, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA), and integrated into the main navigation. Stub out API calls or data bindings where backend integration is not yet available. Document all routes and component structures for future expansion. Prioritize clear separation of concerns and code reusability.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that both pages are accessible from the main navigation and render correctly on all supported devices and browsers. For the Settings page, test that all toggles and editable fields are interactive and update local state as expected. For the About Us page, confirm that all static content is accurate and displays as designed. Run accessibility audits (e.g., axe, Lighthouse) to ensure compliance. Perform code reviews to check for modularity and adherence to design guidelines. Validate that placeholder data can be easily replaced with real backend data in future iterations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Modular Page Structures and Routing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundational structure for the Settings and About Us pages as standalone, modular components. Integrate these pages into the main navigation and configure routing to ensure seamless navigation between them.
### Details:
Use the existing design system to scaffold both pages as independent, reusable components. Set up routes for '/settings' and '/about-us' in the application's router. Ensure each page can be rendered independently for testing and future expansion.

## 2. Implement MVP Settings Page Layout and Sections [pending]
### Dependencies: 93.1
### Description: Develop the Settings page with clearly separated sections for account preferences, notification options, and privacy controls. Use placeholder toggles and editable fields as needed for the MVP.
### Details:
Leverage design system components to create accessible form elements and section containers. Stub out API calls or data bindings for each section, using mock data or placeholders where backend integration is not yet available. Ensure logical grouping and clear labeling for accessibility.

## 3. Develop About Us Page with Company Information [pending]
### Dependencies: 93.1
### Description: Build the About Us page to display company information, mission statement, and contact details, ensuring content is structured and accessible.
### Details:
Use design system typography and layout components to present information clearly. Include placeholders for company logo, mission statement, and contact details. Ensure the page is responsive and meets accessibility standards.

## 4. Ensure Responsiveness and Accessibility Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 93.2, 93.3
### Description: Audit both pages for responsiveness across devices and accessibility per WCAG 2.1 AA standards, making necessary adjustments to layout, navigation, and interactive elements.
### Details:
Test layouts on multiple screen sizes and browsers. Use accessibility testing tools to identify and fix issues related to keyboard navigation, color contrast, ARIA labels, and semantic HTML.

## 5. Document Routes, Component Structures, and Expansion Points [pending]
### Dependencies: 93.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the implemented routes, component hierarchies, and areas designed for future expansion or backend integration.
### Details:
Document the routing configuration, component breakdown for each page, and locations of stubbed API calls or data bindings. Highlight how to extend each section and maintain separation of concerns for future development.
