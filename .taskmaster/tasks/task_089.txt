# Task ID: 89
# Title: Implement Apple SSO with Editable Profile Page and OAuth Popup for MVP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop Apple Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication using OAuth popup, and create a detailed, editable user profile page that integrates real-world Apple accounts for the MVP.
# Details:
Integrate Apple SSO using OAuth 2.0, ensuring the authentication flow uses a secure popup window for user sign-in with real Apple accounts. Upon successful authentication, retrieve and store essential user profile data (e.g., name, email) in the app's backend. Design and implement a profile page that displays all relevant user information and allows users to edit their details (except immutable Apple-provided fields, such as Apple ID email). Ensure the profile page UI is intuitive and supports real-time updates. Handle edge cases such as revoked Apple permissions, sign-out, and error states. Follow best practices for secure OAuth handling and data privacy. Prioritize modular, testable components for both authentication and profile management.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that users can successfully sign in using Apple SSO via the OAuth popup on multiple browsers and devices. Confirm that user profile data is accurately retrieved, displayed, and stored after authentication. Test that the profile page allows editing of permitted fields and that changes persist after saving and page reloads. Ensure that immutable Apple-provided fields are not editable. Simulate revoked permissions and sign-out scenarios to confirm proper handling. Perform security testing for OAuth flow, including token handling and data privacy. Conduct usability testing to ensure the profile page is clear and intuitive.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Apple Developer Account and OAuth Credentials [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the necessary Apple Developer account configurations and register OAuth credentials required for Apple SSO integration
### Details:
Create an App ID in the Apple Developer portal and enable Sign In with Apple capability. Generate a Services ID to be used as the client ID. Create a private key and obtain the Team ID and Key ID. Register these credentials with your application's authentication service, configuring the appropriate redirect URIs and domains. Set a reasonable lifetime for client secrets (between 5 minutes and 6 months).

## 2. Implement OAuth2 Authentication Flow with Popup Window [pending]
### Dependencies: 89.1
### Description: Develop the frontend and backend components needed to handle the Apple OAuth2 authentication flow using a secure popup window
### Details:
Create a route handler (e.g., '/auth/apple') to initiate the OAuth flow. Implement a secure popup window mechanism that directs users to Apple's authentication page. Handle the OAuth callback, including token exchange and validation. Process the authentication response to extract user information. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures, canceled attempts, and timeout scenarios. Store authentication tokens securely and implement refresh token logic if needed.

## 3. User Data Storage and Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 89.2
### Description: Create a system to securely store and manage user profile data retrieved from Apple authentication
### Details:
Design a database schema to store user profile information. Implement API endpoints to retrieve and update user data. Create services to handle the extraction and normalization of user data from Apple's authentication response. Develop logic to merge existing user data with newly provided information from Apple. Implement proper data validation and sanitization. Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations by only storing necessary information and implementing appropriate access controls.

## 4. Design and Implement Editable Profile Page UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 89.3
### Description: Create an intuitive user interface for viewing and editing profile information retrieved from Apple SSO
### Details:
Design a responsive profile page layout that clearly displays all user information. Implement form components for editable fields, ensuring Apple-provided immutable fields (like email) are displayed but not editable. Create real-time validation for user inputs. Implement save/cancel functionality with appropriate feedback. Design and implement loading states, error messages, and success notifications. Ensure the UI is accessible and works across different devices and screen sizes.

## 5. Implement Session Management and Edge Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 89.2, 89.3, 89.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive session management and handle edge cases related to Apple SSO integration
### Details:
Implement secure session management including login state persistence and token refresh mechanisms. Create a sign-out functionality that properly terminates the user session both locally and with Apple. Handle scenarios where Apple permissions are revoked by implementing periodic validation checks. Develop error handling for network issues, expired tokens, and authentication failures. Implement account linking if a user attempts to sign in with Apple but already has an account with a different authentication method. Create appropriate user feedback for all edge cases.
