# Task ID: 51
# Title: Implement Modular, Professional Help & Support Page (P0 Feature)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a modular, reusable, and visually consistent Help & Support page in Sandbox, providing user assistance, FAQs, and contact options, fully compliant with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Reference example code and follow TDD principles throughout implementation.
# Details:
Design and implement a Help & Support page as a set of modular, reusable components (e.g., FAQ accordion, contact form, quick links) to ensure maintainability and scalability. Adhere strictly to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules for all UI elements, typography, and interactions. Reference existing example code for component structure and styling consistency. Ensure the page is accessible, responsive, and easily extensible for future support features. Provide comprehensive documentation for component usage and integration, and ensure all code is clean, well-commented, and follows project conventions. Log this as a high-priority (P0) feature task.

# Test Strategy:
Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) from the outset: write unit and integration tests for all components and user flows before implementation. Validate that all UI elements match the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules, and that the page is fully responsive and accessible. Test all FAQ interactions, contact form submissions, and navigation links for correctness and error handling. Review code for modularity, reusability, and adherence to example code patterns. Conduct peer reviews and user acceptance testing to ensure the page meets all functional and design requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and structure modular help center components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational structure for all modular components needed for the Help & Support page, including component hierarchy, data models, and reusability patterns.
### Details:
Define the component architecture following examples from successful SaaS help centers like Asana, Basecamp, and Monday.com. Create base component templates for FAQ accordion, contact form, search functionality, and quick links. Establish component props and interfaces for each module. Ensure all components follow the Corporate Style Guide for typography, spacing, and color schemes. Document the component structure in the project wiki.

## 2. Implement FAQ accordion component with search functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 51.1
### Description: Develop a reusable accordion component for displaying frequently asked questions with integrated search capability.
### Details:
Build an expandable/collapsible accordion component that displays question-answer pairs. Implement search functionality that filters questions in real-time as users type. Follow the module tabs design pattern for organizing FAQs into categories. Ensure the component is responsive across all device sizes. Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility. Include options for customizing the accordion's appearance while maintaining style guide compliance.

## 3. Develop contact and support request form component [pending]
### Dependencies: 51.1
### Description: Create a modular contact form component that allows users to submit support requests with appropriate validation and feedback.
### Details:
Implement a form component with configurable fields for different support request types. Add client-side validation for all form inputs with appropriate error messages. Create success/failure states for form submission. Integrate with the backend API for submitting support requests. Ensure the form is fully accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation. Add support for file attachments when applicable. Implement form state persistence to prevent data loss.

## 4. Build help center navigation and resource components [pending]
### Dependencies: 51.1
### Description: Implement navigation components and resource cards/links that provide users with quick access to help documentation and support resources.
### Details:
Create a navigation system for the help center that includes categorized links, featured articles, and popular topics. Develop card deck components for displaying help resources in an organized grid layout. Implement a trust bar component to display support credentials or testimonials. Build a conversion panel component to guide users toward live support options when self-help resources aren't sufficient. Ensure all navigation elements are responsive and follow the Corporate Style Guide.

## 5. Integrate and test complete Help & Support page [pending]
### Dependencies: 51.2, 51.3, 51.4
### Description: Assemble all modular components into a cohesive Help & Support page, conduct comprehensive testing, and prepare documentation for future maintenance.
### Details:
Integrate all previously developed components into the main Help & Support page layout. Implement page-level state management to coordinate component interactions. Ensure consistent styling and spacing between components. Add analytics tracking for user interactions with help resources. Create comprehensive documentation for the entire Help & Support system, including component usage examples, customization options, and maintenance guidelines. Conduct final review against Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules compliance.
