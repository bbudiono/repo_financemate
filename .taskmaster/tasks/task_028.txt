# Task ID: 28
# Title: Refactor ContentView.swift for Code Quality, Modularity, Accessibility, and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor _macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/Sources/App/ContentView.swift to achieve over 90% code quality and problem rating, with enhanced navigation, modularity, accessibility, and comprehensive documentation per .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.
# Details:
Analyze ContentView.swift for code smells, large or monolithic structures, and opportunities to extract reusable components or functions. Refactor the code to improve modularity by breaking down complex views or logic into smaller, testable SwiftUI views or helper classes. Enhance navigation by ensuring clear, accessible navigation flows and using SwiftUI best practices for navigation stacks or links. Improve accessibility by adding appropriate accessibility modifiers, labels, and traits to all interactive elements. Add a comprehensive comment block at the top of the file summarizing the file's purpose, main components, and any architectural decisions. Ensure all code and comments comply with .cursorrules §6.4.1 (documentation and clarity) and §8.2 (accessibility and modularity). Document all changes and the rationale for each significant refactor in a dedicated section at the end of the file or in a separate changelog, referencing specific rule compliance. Use SwiftLint or similar tools to enforce code quality standards and prevent regressions. Consider performance optimizations such as lazy loading and efficient state management where applicable.

# Test Strategy:
Review the refactored ContentView.swift with automated code quality tools (e.g., SwiftLint, SonarQube) to confirm >90% code quality and problem rating. Manually inspect the code for modularity, clear navigation, and accessibility compliance, ensuring all interactive elements are accessible via VoiceOver and keyboard navigation. Validate that the comment block and documentation meet .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2 requirements. Run the app and perform end-to-end navigation and accessibility checks. Review the documented rationale for each change to ensure clarity and traceability. Confirm no regressions or new issues are introduced by running the full test suite and performing regression testing on affected features.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze ContentView.swift and Extract Reusable Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the ContentView.swift file to identify code smells, large monolithic structures, and extract reusable components using SwiftUI best practices.
### Details:
Identify large view structures and complex conditional logic in ContentView.swift. Extract reusable components using private variables with 'some View' return types or by creating Group components. For complex UI elements, create separate View structs that conform to the View protocol. Move these extracted components to their own files when appropriate. Document each extracted component with a comment explaining its purpose and usage.

## 2. Implement Navigation Improvements and State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Refactor navigation flows and state management to follow SwiftUI best practices and improve code organization.
### Details:
Review and refactor navigation implementation to use NavigationStack or NavigationView appropriately. Extract navigation-related logic into dedicated components or helper functions. Implement proper state management using @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject, or @EnvironmentObject as appropriate. Create a clear separation between view state and business logic. Document the navigation flow architecture in comments at the top of relevant files.

## 3. Enhance Accessibility Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Add appropriate accessibility modifiers, labels, and traits to all interactive elements in ContentView.swift and extracted components.
### Details:
Audit all UI elements for accessibility compliance. Add .accessibilityLabel(), .accessibilityHint(), and .accessibilityTraits() modifiers to all interactive elements. Ensure proper focus order with .accessibilityElement(children:) where needed. Implement dynamic type support by using appropriate font styles instead of fixed sizes. Test with VoiceOver to ensure all elements are properly announced. Document accessibility considerations for complex UI components.

## 4. Implement Comprehensive Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1, 28.2, 28.3
### Description: Add thorough documentation to ContentView.swift and all extracted components following .cursorrules §6.4.1 standards.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive comment block at the top of ContentView.swift explaining its purpose, main components, and architectural decisions. Document all public functions, properties, and types with descriptive comments. Add inline comments for complex logic or algorithms. Create a dedicated section at the end of the file documenting all refactoring changes and their rationale, with specific references to rule compliance. Use consistent documentation style throughout the codebase.

## 5. Implement Code Quality Checks and Performance Optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1, 28.2, 28.3, 28.4
### Description: Set up code quality tools and implement performance optimizations to achieve over 90% code quality rating.
### Details:
Configure SwiftLint with appropriate rules to enforce code quality standards. Implement performance optimizations such as lazy loading for expensive views using LazyVStack/LazyHStack or on-demand initialization. Review and optimize state management to prevent unnecessary view redraws. Implement efficient list rendering using identifiable protocols and stable identifiers. Add unit tests for business logic and UI tests for critical user flows. Create a final code review checklist to verify compliance with all requirements.
