# Task ID: 83
# Title: Design and Implement Vibrant, Animated SwiftUI Landing Page for MVP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a visually stunning landing page in SwiftUI featuring transparency, gradients, rounded corners, and smooth animations, using best-in-class SwiftUI components and adhering to MVP priorities.
# Details:
Develop a new SwiftUI View for the landing page that showcases a modern, vibrant aesthetic. Use layered gradients for backgrounds, semi-transparent overlays, and rounded corners on all major UI elements. Integrate SwiftUI's animation APIs to animate key elements (e.g., fade-in hero section, button hover effects, animated icons). Employ best-practice SwiftUI components such as VStack, ZStack, and custom Buttons, ensuring the layout is responsive and visually appealing on all supported devices. Prioritize clarity, minimalism, and accessibility, with readable font sizes (minimum 16pt for mobile), clear call-to-action, and mobile-first design. Ensure the code is modular, well-documented, and ready for integration with navigation and authentication flows. Break down the implementation into granular subcomponents (e.g., animated hero section, gradient background, CTA button, feature highlights), and structure the code for easy testing and future enhancements.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the landing page renders correctly on all supported device sizes and orientations, with gradients, transparency, and rounded corners visually consistent. Test all animations for smoothness and performance, ensuring no dropped frames or visual glitches. Confirm that all interactive elements (buttons, links) are accessible and respond as expected. Use accessibility tools to check for proper contrast, font size, and VoiceOver support. Manually test on both light and dark modes. Review code modularity and documentation. Solicit feedback from design and product stakeholders to ensure the page meets MVP visual and functional requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Gradient Background with Transparency and Rounded Corners [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a vibrant, layered gradient background for the landing page, incorporating transparency and rounded corners on all major UI containers to establish the modern aesthetic.
### Details:
Use SwiftUI's ZStack to layer gradients (LinearGradient, RadialGradient, or AngularGradient) and apply .background, .opacity, and .cornerRadius modifiers. Ensure the background adapts to safe areas and different device sizes. Reference Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for color contrast and accessibility compliance.

## 2. Develop Animated Hero Section Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 83.1
### Description: Create a modular hero section featuring animated entrance effects (e.g., fade-in, scale, or slide) for headline text and imagery, ensuring clarity and visual impact.
### Details:
Build a SwiftUI View for the hero section using VStack/ZStack. Integrate with SwiftUI's .animation and .transition APIs for smooth, non-intrusive animations. Ensure text is at least 16pt for readability and supports dynamic type. Structure code for reusability and easy modification.

## 3. Implement Animated Call-to-Action (CTA) Button [pending]
### Dependencies: 83.2
### Description: Design and implement a prominent CTA button with rounded corners, gradient fill, and animated hover/tap effects to encourage user interaction.
### Details:
Use SwiftUI's Button with custom styling, gradients, and .cornerRadius. Add interactive animations using .onHover (for iPad/Mac) and .onTapGesture for mobile, leveraging .scaleEffect or .opacity for feedback. Ensure button is accessible, with clear labeling and sufficient touch target size.

## 4. Showcase Feature Highlights with Animated Icons [pending]
### Dependencies: 83.3
### Description: Create a horizontally or vertically scrolling section that highlights key features, each with an animated icon and concise description, maintaining visual consistency and clarity.
### Details:
Use LazyHStack or LazyVStack for layout. Integrate animated icons using SwiftUI's animation APIs or Lottie for richer effects. Ensure each feature card uses gradients, transparency, and rounded corners for cohesion. Keep descriptions brief and readable.

## 5. Ensure Responsiveness, Accessibility, and Code Modularity [pending]
### Dependencies: 83.4
### Description: Refine the landing page for responsiveness across devices, enforce accessibility standards, and modularize code for maintainability and future integration.
### Details:
Test and adjust layouts using GeometryReader and ViewThatFits for adaptive sizing. Audit all components for accessibility (color contrast, dynamic type, VoiceOver support). Extract reusable subviews and document code for clarity. Prepare for integration with navigation/auth flows.
