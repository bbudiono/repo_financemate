# Task ID: 84
# Title: Implement SSO-Driven Profile/Data Synchronization with User Model for MVP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable seamless sharing and synchronization of user profile data between Single Sign-On (SSO) providers and the application's Profile/User model, ensuring accurate and secure data mapping for MVP.
# Details:
Integrate the SSO authentication flow (Apple and Google SSO) with the application's Profile/User model so that, upon successful authentication, relevant user attributes (e.g., name, email, avatar) are extracted from the SSO provider and mapped to the local user profile. Design a robust mapping layer to handle differences in attribute naming and data formats between SSO providers and the internal model. Ensure that user records are created or updated as needed, handling edge cases such as existing users with matching emails. Implement secure handling of sensitive data, following best practices for identity and access management, including the principle of least privilege and encrypted storage where appropriate. Provide clear error handling and logging for failed synchronizations. Prioritize only essential profile fields for MVP, deferring non-critical attributes to future iterations.

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit and integration tests to verify correct extraction and mapping of SSO profile data to the user model for both Apple and Google SSO flows. Test scenarios including new user registration, existing user login, and profile updates. Validate that only intended fields are synchronized and that sensitive data is handled securely. Manually test edge cases such as conflicting emails, missing attributes, and SSO provider errors. Confirm that logs and error messages are generated appropriately for failed sync attempts. Review implementation against SSO and data security best practices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate SSO Authentication Flow for Apple and Google [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement and configure the authentication flow for Apple and Google SSO using appropriate protocols (OIDC/OAuth2), ensuring secure token validation and session management.
### Details:
Use established libraries (e.g., Passport.js, Spring Security) to handle SSO authentication. Configure client IDs, secrets, and redirect URIs for both Apple and Google. Ensure secure handling of tokens and validate them according to provider documentation.

## 2. Extract and Normalize SSO User Attributes [pending]
### Dependencies: 84.1
### Description: Develop logic to extract essential user attributes (name, email, avatar) from SSO provider responses and normalize them into a consistent internal format.
### Details:
Map provider-specific attribute names and formats to a unified internal schema. Handle missing or optional fields gracefully. Prepare a mapping layer to abstract differences between Apple and Google attribute structures.

## 3. Design and Implement Profile/User Model Mapping Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 84.2
### Description: Create a robust mapping layer that translates normalized SSO attributes to the application's Profile/User model, handling data type conversions and validation.
### Details:
Define mapping rules for each profile field. Implement logic to convert and validate data types (e.g., string to date). Ensure only MVP-essential fields are mapped, deferring non-critical attributes.

## 4. Implement User Record Creation and Update Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 84.3
### Description: Develop logic to create new user records or update existing ones based on SSO data, handling edge cases such as existing users with matching emails.
### Details:
Check for existing users by email or unique identifier. If found, update profile fields as needed; otherwise, create a new user record. Ensure idempotency and prevent duplicate accounts.

## 5. Secure Data Handling, Error Management, and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 84.4
### Description: Implement secure storage and handling of sensitive user data, following best practices for encryption and access control. Add comprehensive error handling and logging for synchronization failures.
### Details:
Encrypt sensitive fields at rest and in transit. Apply the principle of least privilege for data access. Implement structured logging for synchronization attempts and failures, and provide clear error messages for troubleshooting.
