# Task ID: 58
# Title: Refactor Main.swift for Entry Point Structure, Modularity, and Maintainability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor Main.swift in the Sandbox project to improve the entry point structure, modularity, and maintainability, targeting over 90% code and problem rating. Expand or add tests, update the comment block, and ensure full alignment with the Corporate Style Guide.
# Details:
Analyze the current Main.swift file to identify tightly coupled logic, monolithic structures, or code that can be modularized. Refactor the entry point to clearly separate concerns (e.g., configuration, dependency injection, app launch logic) and extract reusable components or functions where appropriate. Ensure all code adheres to the Corporate Style Guide, including naming conventions, formatting, and documentation standards. Update the file's comment block to provide a clear summary of its purpose, usage, and any relevant details. Where possible, leverage Swift best practices for initialization and modularity, such as static methods or protocols for encapsulation. Ensure the refactored code is easy to maintain and extend. Expand or add unit and integration tests to cover all new and existing logic, aiming for comprehensive coverage and robust verification of entry point behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Review the refactored Main.swift to confirm clear separation of concerns, modular structure, and adherence to the Corporate Style Guide. Run static analysis and code quality tools to verify a code and problem rating above 90%. Execute all existing and new tests, ensuring at least 90% code coverage and that all entry point logic is exercised. Manually inspect the updated comment block for completeness and clarity. Perform peer code review to validate maintainability, modularity, and style compliance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and Identify Refactoring Opportunities in Main.swift [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the current Main.swift file to identify tightly coupled logic, monolithic structures, and areas lacking modularity. Document specific sections that require separation of concerns or can be extracted into reusable components.
### Details:
Perform a thorough code review focusing on entry point structure, configuration, dependency injection, and app launch logic. Note any violations of the Corporate Style Guide and Swift best practices.

## 2. Refactor Entry Point for Clear Structure and Modularity [pending]
### Dependencies: 58.1
### Description: Restructure Main.swift to separate concerns such as configuration, dependency injection, and app launch logic. Extract reusable components or functions where appropriate to improve modularity and maintainability.
### Details:
Apply Swift best practices, such as using static methods or protocols for encapsulation. Move tightly coupled or monolithic code into distinct functions or types, ensuring each has a single responsibility.

## 3. Align Code with Corporate Style Guide and Update Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 58.2
### Description: Ensure all code in Main.swift adheres to the Corporate Style Guide, including naming conventions, formatting, and documentation standards. Update the file's comment block to provide a clear summary of its purpose, usage, and relevant details.
### Details:
Review and revise code formatting, naming, and inline documentation. Rewrite or expand the comment block at the top of Main.swift to reflect the refactored structure and its intended use.

## 4. Expand and Add Unit and Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 58.2
### Description: Develop or expand unit and integration tests to cover all new and existing logic in Main.swift, targeting over 90% code and problem rating coverage.
### Details:
Identify testable units in the refactored code. Write tests for configuration, dependency injection, and app launch logic. Ensure tests cover both typical and edge cases.

## 5. Review, Validate, and Finalize Refactored Main.swift [pending]
### Dependencies: 58.3, 58.4
### Description: Conduct a final review of the refactored Main.swift to ensure modularity, maintainability, style compliance, and test coverage. Address any outstanding issues and prepare the file for integration.
### Details:
Perform peer code reviews, validate against the Corporate Style Guide, and confirm all tests pass. Make final adjustments as needed before merging changes.
