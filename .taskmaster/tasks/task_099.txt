# Task ID: 99
# Title: Test TaskMaster-AI Real API Integration with FinanceMate Document Processing Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 9, 15, 31, 61, 98
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement and test the integration between TaskMaster-AI API and FinanceMate's document processing workflow that includes OCR, data extraction, and financial analysis capabilities.
# Details:
1. Create a dedicated integration service class `TaskMasterDocumentProcessingService` that handles API communication with TaskMaster-AI.

2. Implement the following key components:
   - Authentication handler for secure API access using OAuth tokens
   - Document upload functionality with multi-part form support for various file formats (PDF, JPEG, PNG)
   - OCR processing request/response handlers
   - Data extraction endpoints for financial document parsing
   - Financial analysis result processing and mapping to FinanceMate data models

3. Develop a queuing system for handling document processing requests:
   - Implement background processing using DispatchQueue or Operation queues
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests
   - Create a persistent storage mechanism for tracking processing status

4. Create data transformation layers:
   - Map TaskMaster-AI response formats to FinanceMate document models
   - Implement validation for extracted financial data
   - Build error handling for malformed or incomplete data

5. Implement user feedback mechanisms:
   - Progress indicators for document processing stages
   - Error messaging with actionable recovery steps
   - Success notifications with summary of extracted data

6. Add configuration options:
   - API endpoint configuration for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
   - Processing priority settings
   - OCR quality/speed tradeoff options
   - Timeout and retry policy settings

7. Implement proper error handling and logging:
   - Categorize errors (network, authentication, processing, validation)
   - Log detailed error information for debugging
   - Implement user-friendly error messages

8. Ensure the integration follows security best practices:
   - Secure storage of API credentials
   - Data encryption for sensitive financial information
   - Proper certificate validation for API connections

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create mock TaskMaster-AI API responses for different document types
   - Test authentication flow with valid and invalid credentials
   - Verify proper handling of various API response codes (200, 400, 401, 500)
   - Test data transformation logic with sample responses
   - Validate error handling for different failure scenarios

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up a test environment with TaskMaster-AI sandbox API
   - Create a suite of test documents representing different financial document types
   - Verify end-to-end document processing workflow with actual API calls
   - Test concurrent document processing with multiple simultaneous requests
   - Validate proper handling of rate limiting and service unavailability

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure processing time for different document sizes and types
   - Test memory usage during batch document processing
   - Verify application responsiveness during background processing

4. User Interface Testing:
   - Verify progress indicators accurately reflect processing status
   - Test error message display and recovery options
   - Validate that extracted data is correctly displayed in the UI

5. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure existing document functionality continues to work
   - Verify that offline capabilities remain functional
   - Test backward compatibility with previously processed documents

6. Security Testing:
   - Verify secure storage of API credentials
   - Test for proper handling of sensitive financial data
   - Validate API connection security with network traffic analysis

7. Create a comprehensive test report documenting:
   - Test coverage metrics
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Identified issues and resolutions
   - Recommendations for production deployment
