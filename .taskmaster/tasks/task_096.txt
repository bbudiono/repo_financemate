# Task ID: 96
# Title: Define and Document Modular, Reusable UX/UI Component Library for MVP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish a comprehensive, prioritized list of modular, reusable, and dynamic UX/UI components required for the MVP, with detailed specifications and usage guidelines.
# Details:
Conduct a thorough analysis of the MVP's user flows and views to identify all necessary UI components (e.g., buttons, cards, modals, input fields, alerts, navigation elements). For each component, document its purpose, required states (default, hover, active, disabled, error), dynamic behaviors, and visual style requirements to ensure vibrancy and professionalism. Specify props, slots, and customization options to maximize reusability and modularity. Organize components into a clear hierarchy and prioritize them based on MVP needs. Include usage examples and design references to guide implementation. Collaborate with design and development teams to validate feasibility and alignment with the overall UX vision.

# Test Strategy:
Review the component library documentation with design and engineering leads to ensure completeness, clarity, and alignment with MVP requirements. Validate that each component specification includes all necessary states, behaviors, and customization options. Confirm that the prioritized list covers all UI needs for the MVP and that usage guidelines are clear enough for efficient implementation and testing. Solicit feedback from stakeholders and iterate as needed before moving to development.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze MVP User Flows and Identify Required Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review all MVP user flows and screens to extract a comprehensive list of necessary modular, reusable UX/UI components (e.g., buttons, cards, modals, input fields, alerts, navigation elements).
### Details:
Work closely with product and design documentation to map out every user interaction and view. List each unique UI element required, ensuring coverage of all functional and visual needs for the MVP. Organize findings in a structured inventory.

## 2. Define Component Specifications and States [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.1
### Description: For each identified component, document its purpose, required states (default, hover, active, disabled, error), dynamic behaviors, and visual style requirements.
### Details:
Create a detailed specification sheet for each component, outlining its anatomy, state transitions, and visual guidelines. Include requirements for vibrancy, professionalism, and accessibility. Reference design system best practices for clarity and completeness.

## 3. Specify Props, Slots, and Customization Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.2
### Description: Detail the API for each component, including all props, slots, and customization options to maximize reusability and modularity.
### Details:
For every component, list all configurable properties, slots for content injection, and styling overrides. Ensure documentation is clear on how to extend or adapt components for different use cases within the MVP.

## 4. Organize Components into Hierarchy and Prioritize [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.3
### Description: Structure the component list into a clear hierarchy (e.g., atoms, molecules, organisms) and prioritize components based on MVP needs.
### Details:
Group components by complexity and usage frequency. Assign priority levels to guide implementation order, focusing on foundational and high-impact components first. Use visual matrices or tables for clarity.

## 5. Document Usage Guidelines, Examples, and Design References [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.4
### Description: For each component, provide usage guidelines, code/design examples, and references to design assets. Collaborate with design and development teams to validate feasibility and alignment.
### Details:
Write clear documentation for when and how to use each component, including best practices, do's and don'ts, and accessibility notes. Include code snippets and design references. Facilitate review sessions with design and development to ensure documentation is actionable and accurate.
