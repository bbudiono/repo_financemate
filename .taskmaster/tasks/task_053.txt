# Task ID: 53
# Title: Implement Modular, Professional Landing / Get Started / Features Page (P0 Feature)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a modular, reusable, and visually engaging Landing / Get Started / Features page in Sandbox as the primary entry point for new users, ensuring full compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. This page must be user-focused, vibrant, and reference example code, following TDD principles throughout implementation.
# Details:
Design and implement a Landing / Get Started / Features page that serves as the main onboarding and introduction point for new users in Sandbox. The page should be modular and reusable, allowing for easy updates and integration of new features. Ensure the layout is clear and compelling, with a strong visual hierarchy, prominent calls to action, and strategic use of brand colors, fonts, and imagery in line with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Incorporate essential landing page elements such as a headline, subheadline, hero section, feature highlights, social proof, and a clear CTA. Reference high-quality example code and design inspiration to ensure a professional and vibrant user experience. All code should be organized for maintainability and reusability, with components structured for easy testing and future extension. Treat this as a high-priority (P0) feature task.

# Test Strategy:
Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles: write comprehensive unit and UI tests before implementation. Tests must verify correct rendering of all page sections (headline, subheadline, hero, features, CTA), compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules, accessibility standards, responsiveness across devices, and correct integration of modular components. Validate that the page serves as the default entry point for new users and that all interactive elements function as intended. Peer review and design QA must confirm visual and functional alignment with provided example code and design references.
