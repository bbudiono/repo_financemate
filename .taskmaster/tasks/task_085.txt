# Task ID: 85
# Title: Define Core Data Model Entities and Relationships for MVP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement the initial Core Data model, including entities, attributes, and relationships for user and app data, to support MVP requirements.
# Details:
Use Xcode's Core Data Model Editor to create a new data model file. Define granular entities such as User, Profile, and any essential app-specific data objects required for MVP. Specify attributes (e.g., name, email, creationDate) and relationships (e.g., User has Profile, User owns AppData) with appropriate types and constraints. Ensure the model supports SSO-driven synchronization and anticipated CRUD operations. Document the schema and rationale for each entity and relationship. Commit the .xcdatamodeld file to version control and ensure naming consistency with the Core Data stack initialization. Prepare for future migrations by using versioned model files if necessary.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the .xcdatamodeld file exists and contains all required entities, attributes, and relationships. Use Xcode's model validation tools to check for schema errors. Write unit tests to instantiate managed objects, persist them, and fetch them using NSPredicate queries. Confirm that the model supports SSO-driven data mapping and CRUD operations as required by the MVP. Review documentation for completeness and clarity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Data Model File and Define User Entity [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the initial .xcdatamodeld file and define the User entity with all required attributes for MVP
### Details:
Use Xcode's Core Data Model Editor to create a new .xcdatamodeld file. Define the User entity with essential attributes such as userId (String), email (String), name (String), and creationDate (Date). Set appropriate data types, constraints, and default values. Mark required fields and consider indexing frequently queried attributes for performance. Document the purpose of each attribute in the model editor.

## 2. Define Profile Entity and User-Profile Relationship [pending]
### Dependencies: 85.1
### Description: Create the Profile entity and establish its relationship with the User entity
### Details:
Define the Profile entity with attributes like profileId, avatar, preferences, and lastUpdated. Establish a one-to-one relationship between User and Profile entities with appropriate delete rules (e.g., cascade delete). Configure inverse relationships and ensure proper relationship cardinality. Document the relationship constraints and rationale in code comments.

## 3. Define App-Specific Data Entities and Relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: 85.1
### Description: Create additional entities required for app functionality and establish their relationships
### Details:
Based on MVP requirements, define app-specific entities (e.g., Content, Settings) with appropriate attributes. Establish relationships between User and these entities with proper cardinality (one-to-many or many-to-many). Configure delete rules and inverse relationships. Ensure the model supports all required CRUD operations for MVP. Document each entity's purpose and relationship rationale.

## 4. Implement SSO Synchronization Support in Model [pending]
### Dependencies: 85.1, 85.2, 85.3
### Description: Enhance the data model to support SSO-driven synchronization requirements
### Details:
Add synchronization-specific attributes to relevant entities (e.g., lastSyncDate, syncStatus, serverIdentifier). Create any necessary junction entities for complex relationships that need to be synchronized. Ensure all entities that require synchronization have appropriate unique identifiers. Document the synchronization strategy and how the model supports it.

## 5. Prepare Model for Future Migrations [pending]
### Dependencies: 85.1, 85.2, 85.3, 85.4
### Description: Set up versioning and document the schema to support future migrations
### Details:
Configure the model for lightweight migration by setting appropriate version identifiers. Create a comprehensive schema documentation including entity diagrams, attribute descriptions, and relationship explanations. Establish naming conventions for future model versions. Commit the finalized .xcdatamodeld file to version control with appropriate documentation. Consider creating a baseline migration test to verify model integrity.
