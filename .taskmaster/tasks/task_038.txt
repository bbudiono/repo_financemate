# Task ID: 38
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Unit Tests for Refactored GoogleAuthProvider (TDD, P0)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 37
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and update modular, maintainable unit tests for the refactored GoogleAuthProvider in Sandbox, ensuring full coverage of OAuth flows, error handling, and User model integration per TDD and .cursorrules. Log as a P0 test task and link to Task #37.
# Details:
Design and implement unit tests for the refactored GoogleAuthProvider (from Task #37), ensuring all public APIs and behaviors are tested according to TDD principles. Cover all OAuth authentication flows (including success, failure, and edge cases), error handling scenarios, and integration points with the User model. Structure tests to be modular and maintainable, following .cursorrules ยง6.4.1 and ยง5.3.1, and ensure compliance with project-specific test conventions. Use mocking and stubbing for external dependencies (e.g., network calls, token exchanges) to isolate unit logic. Document test cases clearly and ensure tests are easily extensible for future SSO providers. Reference Task #37 in all relevant documentation and commit messages.

# Test Strategy:
Verify completion by ensuring: (1) 100% code coverage of all public methods and critical paths in GoogleAuthProvider; (2) tests comprehensively cover all OAuth flows, error handling, and User model integration; (3) tests are modular, isolated, and maintainable; (4) all tests pass reliably in CI; (5) code and tests are reviewed for .cursorrules compliance; (6) test documentation references Task #37 and clearly describes coverage and rationale.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up test environment and mock dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the test environment structure for GoogleAuthProvider unit tests, including necessary mocks for external dependencies
### Details:
Initialize the test environment with appropriate configuration. Create mock implementations for OAuth API calls, token exchanges, and any external services. Set up test fixtures and helper utilities for common test scenarios. Ensure proper isolation of the GoogleAuthProvider component from its dependencies.

## 2. Implement authentication flow success path tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.1
### Description: Develop unit tests covering the successful authentication flows through GoogleAuthProvider
### Details:
Create test cases for the complete authentication flow, including initialization, authorization request, token exchange, and user profile retrieval. Verify that the provider correctly processes authentication responses and generates the expected User model instances. Test different valid authentication scenarios and parameter variations.

## 3. Implement authentication flow failure and edge case tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.2
### Description: Develop unit tests for error handling and edge cases in the GoogleAuthProvider authentication flows
### Details:
Create test cases for various failure scenarios: invalid tokens, expired tokens, network failures, malformed responses, and permission denials. Test edge cases such as partial data in responses, timeout handling, and retry logic. Ensure the provider handles all error conditions gracefully and provides appropriate error information.

## 4. Implement User model integration tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.2
### Description: Develop tests for the integration between GoogleAuthProvider and the User model
### Details:
Test the mapping of Google user profile data to the application's User model. Verify that user attributes are correctly extracted and transformed. Test user creation, update, and retrieval flows. Ensure that user identity is properly maintained across authentication sessions.

## 5. Implement test documentation and compliance verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.1, 38.2, 38.3, 38.4
### Description: Document all test cases and verify compliance with project standards and TDD principles
### Details:
Create comprehensive documentation for all test cases, including purpose, expected behavior, and coverage analysis. Verify that tests follow .cursorrules ยง6.4.1 and ยง5.3.1 requirements. Ensure tests are modular, maintainable, and follow project-specific conventions. Add references to Task #37 in all relevant documentation and commit messages.
