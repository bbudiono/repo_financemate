# Task ID: 50
# Title: Implement Comprehensive UI and Unit Tests for About Us Page (P0 Test Task)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 49
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and update thorough UI and unit tests for the new About Us page in Sandbox, ensuring full coverage of content, navigation, and UI/UX compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. This task must follow TDD principles and be logged as a P0 test task linked to Task #49.
# Details:
Begin by reviewing the About Us page implementation (Task #49) and the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules to identify all UI/UX requirements and content elements. Design unit tests to verify all functional logic, including rendering of company/app information, support links, and any modular components. Implement UI tests to simulate user interactions, navigation flows, and visual compliance, using tools such as React Testing Library or Cypress as appropriate. Ensure tests are readable, deterministic, and follow naming conventions that clearly describe the scenario and expected outcome. Use TDD: write failing tests first, then implement or update code to pass them. Document all test cases and ensure traceability to requirements. All tests must be independent, portable, and provide detailed reporting on failures. Coordinate with Task #49 to ensure alignment and update tests as the About Us page evolves.

# Test Strategy:
Verify completion by ensuring 100% coverage of all About Us page features, including content rendering, navigation, and UI/UX compliance. Run all unit and UI tests in isolation and as part of the CI pipeline, confirming they pass consistently. Review test names and documentation for clarity and traceability. Manually inspect test reports to confirm that all Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules requirements are validated. Cross-reference tests with Task #49 acceptance criteria and ensure all edge cases and user interactions are covered. Confirm that tests fail when requirements are not met and pass when the implementation is correct.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review About Us Page Implementation and Gather Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the About Us page implementation (Task #49), Corporate Style Guide, and .cursorrules to identify all UI/UX requirements, content elements, and navigation flows that must be tested.
### Details:
Carefully review the latest About Us page codebase and documentation. Extract all functional, content, and style requirements. Document each requirement and map them to testable scenarios, ensuring traceability for later test case documentation.

## 2. Design Unit Tests for Functional Logic and Content Rendering [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.1
### Description: Draft unit tests covering all functional logic, including rendering of company/app information, support links, and modular components, following TDD principles.
### Details:
Use Jest and React Testing Library to write initial failing unit tests for each identified requirement. Focus on verifying correct rendering, state/prop handling, and event callbacks. Ensure tests are descriptive, isolated, and follow naming conventions.

## 3. Design UI Tests for User Interactions and Navigation Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.1
### Description: Develop UI tests simulating user interactions, navigation, and visual compliance with the Corporate Style Guide, using tools such as React Testing Library or Cypress.
### Details:
Write UI tests that simulate real user behavior, such as clicking links, navigating between sections, and verifying visual elements. Use userEvent utilities for interaction simulation and screen queries for accessibility-focused assertions.

## 4. Implement and Refine About Us Page to Pass All Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.2, 50.3
### Description: Update or implement About Us page code to pass all previously written unit and UI tests, iterating as needed to achieve full coverage and compliance.
### Details:
Follow TDD: update the About Us page implementation only as needed to make failing tests pass. Refactor code for clarity and maintainability, ensuring all requirements are met and tests remain green.

## 5. Document Test Cases and Ensure Traceability [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.4
### Description: Document all test cases, mapping each to specific requirements, and ensure traceability and detailed reporting for failures. Coordinate with Task #49 for ongoing alignment.
### Details:
Create or update documentation listing each test case, its purpose, and the requirement it covers. Ensure all tests provide clear failure messages and are portable. Communicate with the team to keep test coverage aligned with evolving requirements.
