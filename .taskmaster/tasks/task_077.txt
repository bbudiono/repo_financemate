# Task ID: 77
# Title: Write Unit Tests for AuthenticationService
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create unit tests for the AuthenticationService, focusing on the signInWithApple functionality to ensure it behaves as expected and to facilitate TDD for further SSO development. Cover success and failure cases.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up test environment with mocks for Apple SSO dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the necessary test infrastructure to isolate the AuthenticationService from external dependencies during testing
### Details:
Create mock implementations for Apple authentication APIs and any other external services. Set up the testing framework with appropriate configuration for dependency injection. Implement helper methods to simulate different authentication scenarios.

## 2. Implement basic success path tests for signInWithApple [pending]
### Dependencies: 77.1
### Description: Write unit tests that verify the signInWithApple method works correctly when authentication succeeds
### Details:
Create test cases that verify the method returns the expected user object on successful authentication. Test that the correct tokens are stored and that user session is properly initialized. Follow the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern for clear test structure.

## 3. Implement failure path tests for signInWithApple [pending]
### Dependencies: 77.2
### Description: Write unit tests that verify the signInWithApple method handles authentication failures appropriately
### Details:
Create test cases for various failure scenarios including network errors, invalid credentials, and server errors. Verify that appropriate error objects are returned and that the service doesn't leave the system in an inconsistent state after failures.

## 4. Implement edge case tests for signInWithApple [pending]
### Dependencies: 77.3
### Description: Write unit tests that cover edge cases and boundary conditions for the signInWithApple functionality
### Details:
Test scenarios such as token expiration, partial authentication completion, timeout conditions, and retry logic. Verify that the service handles unexpected input values gracefully. Include tests for concurrent authentication attempts if applicable.

## 5. Document test coverage and create test automation setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 77.4
### Description: Document the test coverage achieved and set up automated test execution as part of the CI/CD pipeline
### Details:
Generate test coverage reports to identify any gaps in testing. Create documentation explaining the testing approach and how to run the tests. Configure the tests to run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions early.
