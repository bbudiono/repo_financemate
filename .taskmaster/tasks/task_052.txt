# Task ID: 52
# Title: Implement Comprehensive UI and Unit Tests for Help & Support Page (P0 Test Task)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 51
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and update thorough UI and unit tests for the new Help & Support page in Sandbox, ensuring full coverage of content, navigation, and UI/UX compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. This task must follow TDD principles and be logged as a P0 test task linked to Task #51.
# Details:
Begin by reviewing the implementation details and requirements from Task #51, including all user flows, content sections (FAQs, contact options, etc.), and visual elements. Design and implement unit tests to validate component rendering, state management, and logic, using the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern for clarity and maintainability. For UI tests, automate user interactions such as navigation between sections, form submissions, and accessibility checks, ensuring all elements adhere to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Use a BDD framework where possible to improve test readability and documentation. Ensure tests are deterministic, isolated, and named descriptively. Maintain comprehensive test documentation and link all test cases to the relevant requirements from Task #51. All work must be performed using TDD, writing tests before implementation or refactoring.

# Test Strategy:
Verify completion by ensuring 100% test coverage for all new and updated components on the Help & Support page, including content rendering, navigation, and UI/UX compliance. Run all unit and UI tests in CI, confirming they pass consistently and are deterministic. Manually review test cases for alignment with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Validate that all user flows (e.g., accessing FAQs, submitting support requests) are covered by automated tests. Confirm that the test suite is well-documented, follows the AAA pattern, and that all tests are linked to Task #51. Review test logs and reports to ensure no regressions or untested areas remain.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review Requirements and Define Test Coverage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze Task #51's implementation details, user flows, content sections, and visual/UI requirements. Identify all areas of the Help & Support page that require testing, including navigation, content (FAQs, contact options), and compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules.
### Details:
Gather all documentation and requirements from Task #51. Create a comprehensive test plan outlining required unit and UI test cases, mapping each to specific requirements and user flows. Ensure all content sections and navigation paths are included.

## 2. Design Unit Tests Using TDD and AAA Pattern [pending]
### Dependencies: 52.1
### Description: Write unit test specifications for all Help & Support page components, focusing on rendering, state management, and logic. Use the Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) pattern for clarity and maintainability, and ensure tests are written before implementation or refactoring.
### Details:
For each component and logic unit, define test cases that cover normal, edge, and error scenarios. Use mocks and stubs to isolate tests and ensure they are deterministic and fast. Name tests descriptively and group related tests logically.

## 3. Implement Automated UI Tests for Navigation and Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 52.2
### Description: Develop automated UI tests to validate user interactions, navigation between sections, form submissions, and accessibility. Ensure tests verify compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules.
### Details:
Use a BDD framework to write readable, behavior-driven UI test scenarios. Automate navigation flows, check for correct rendering of content, and validate accessibility features. Test on multiple devices and browsers if possible.

## 4. Ensure Test Isolation, Determinism, and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 52.3
### Description: Refactor and organize tests to guarantee isolation and determinism. Document all test cases, linking them to specific requirements from Task #51, and maintain clear, up-to-date test documentation.
### Details:
Review all tests to ensure no shared state or external dependencies. Use descriptive naming and group tests logically. Maintain a living document or test suite index that maps each test to its corresponding requirement or user flow.

## 5. Integrate Tests into CI Pipeline and Log as P0 Test Task [pending]
### Dependencies: 52.4
### Description: Integrate all unit and UI tests into the continuous integration (CI) pipeline. Ensure the tests are executed on every build, and log this work as a P0 test task linked to Task #51 for traceability and compliance.
### Details:
Configure the CI pipeline to run all tests automatically. Set up reporting for test results and failures. Document the linkage between this P0 test task and Task #51 in the project management system.
