# Task ID: 31
# Title: Refactor FinanceMateSandboxTests.swift for Code Quality, Coverage, and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor _macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/Tests/FinanceMateSandboxTests.swift to achieve over 90% code quality and problem rating, add comprehensive comment blocks, expand test coverage, and ensure full compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2. Document all changes and rationale.
# Details:
Review the existing FinanceMateSandboxTests.swift file for code quality issues, including naming conventions, test structure, and assertion clarity. Refactor test methods to ensure each verifies a single concern, uses descriptive names, and applies the most informative assertions (e.g., prefer XCTAssertEqual over generic XCTAssert). Expand test coverage to include all public interfaces and edge cases, aiming for over 90% code coverage as measured by Xcode's built-in tools. Add a comprehensive file-level comment block summarizing the file's purpose, authorship, and usage. Ensure all code and comments comply with .cursorrules §6.4.1 (documentation standards) and §8.2 (test structure and clarity). Document all changes and the rationale for each modification in a dedicated section at the end of the file or in a separate changelog. Avoid leaking test code into production and do not weaken encapsulation solely for testing purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Run the full test suite and verify that code coverage exceeds 90% using Xcode's code coverage tools. Review all test methods to ensure each tests a single concern and uses clear, descriptive names. Confirm that all public interfaces and edge cases are covered by tests. Check that the file contains a comprehensive comment block and that all code and comments adhere to .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2. Review the documented rationale for each change for completeness and clarity. Optionally, perform a peer review to validate code quality, coverage, and compliance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current Test Structure and Create Refactoring Plan [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a comprehensive analysis of FinanceMateSandboxTests.swift to identify code quality issues, test coverage gaps, and compliance violations with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.
### Details:
Review the existing test file structure, focusing on naming conventions, test organization, and assertion usage. Document all identified issues in a structured format. Calculate current code coverage metrics using Xcode's built-in tools. Create a detailed refactoring plan with specific goals for each area of improvement. Reference the .cursorrules documentation to ensure full understanding of §6.4.1 and §8.2 requirements.

## 2. Implement Comprehensive Documentation and Comment Blocks [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Add file-level documentation and appropriate comment blocks throughout the test file to comply with .cursorrules §6.4.1.
### Details:
Create a file-level comment block that includes purpose, authorship, version history, and usage instructions. Add descriptive comments for each test class and method explaining what is being tested and why. Document any test fixtures or helper methods. Ensure all comments follow a consistent format and provide meaningful context rather than simply restating the code.

## 3. Refactor Test Methods for Clarity and Single Responsibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.1, 31.2
### Description: Restructure test methods to ensure each verifies a single concern, uses descriptive names, and applies the most appropriate assertions.
### Details:
Rename test methods to clearly describe what they're testing using a consistent naming convention (e.g., test_functionName_scenario_expectedResult). Split tests that verify multiple concerns into separate methods. Replace generic assertions (XCTAssert) with more specific ones (XCTAssertEqual, XCTAssertTrue, etc.) that provide better failure messages. Organize related tests into logical test case groupings. Ensure setup and teardown methods are properly implemented.

## 4. Expand Test Coverage to Meet 90% Target [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.3
### Description: Identify and implement additional tests to cover untested code paths, edge cases, and error conditions.
### Details:
Use Xcode's code coverage tools to identify untested or undertested areas of the codebase. Implement new test methods for uncovered code paths, focusing on edge cases, error handling, and boundary conditions. Create tests for all public interfaces. Ensure tests are independent and don't rely on execution order. Add appropriate mocks or stubs where needed to isolate tests from external dependencies.

## 5. Document Changes and Verify Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.2, 31.3, 31.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation of all changes made during refactoring and verify full compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.
### Details:
Create a detailed changelog documenting all modifications made during the refactoring process, including rationale for each change. Add this either as a dedicated section at the end of the file or as a separate document. Perform a final review against .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2 requirements to ensure full compliance. Verify that no test code leaks into production and that encapsulation hasn't been weakened solely for testing purposes.
