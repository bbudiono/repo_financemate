# Task ID: 54
# Title: Refactor Low-Rated Swift Files for Code Quality and .cursorrules Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor all FinanceMate-Sandbox Swift files with a code/problem rating below 70% to achieve over 90%, ensuring full .cursorrules compliance, improved modularity, maintainability, and comprehensive documentation. Expand or add tests as needed and log all changes with updated documentation.
# Details:
Begin by auditing all Swift files in the FinanceMate-Sandbox repository, identifying those with a code/problem rating below 70%. For each file, refactor code to improve readability, modularity, and maintainability, following Swift best practices such as extracting methods, reducing complexity, and enforcing strong typing. Ensure all code fully complies with .cursorrules and add or complete comment blocks for all public types, methods, and complex logic. Use Swiftâ€™s refactoring tools in Xcode (e.g., Rename, Extract Method) to streamline the process and prevent regressions. Update or create unit and integration tests to cover all refactored code, ensuring no loss of functionality. Maintain a detailed changelog of all modifications and update any relevant documentation to reflect the new code structure and usage. Commit changes frequently to preserve a clear history and facilitate code review.

# Test Strategy:
For each refactored file, verify that the code/problem rating exceeds 90% using the project's established metrics. Run all existing and newly created unit and integration tests to confirm full coverage and correct behavior. Use static analysis and linter tools (including .cursorrules compliance checks) to ensure code quality and style adherence. Manually review comment blocks for completeness and clarity. Confirm that all changes are logged and that documentation accurately reflects the updated codebase. Conduct peer code reviews to validate maintainability and modularity improvements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit Swift Files and Identify Low-Rated Candidates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Scan all Swift files in the FinanceMate-Sandbox repository to identify those with a code/problem rating below 70%. Document the list of files to be refactored.
### Details:
Use automated code analysis tools or scripts to assess each file's code/problem rating. Compile a list of files falling below the 70% threshold, noting key issues and areas for improvement.

## 2. Refactor Code for Quality, Modularity, and Maintainability [pending]
### Dependencies: 54.1
### Description: Refactor each identified file to improve readability, modularity, and maintainability, targeting a code/problem rating above 90%.
### Details:
Apply Swift best practices such as extracting methods, reducing complexity, enforcing strong typing, and leveraging Xcode's refactoring tools (e.g., Rename, Extract Method). Ensure code is clean, organized, and follows modern Swift conventions.

## 3. Ensure Full .cursorrules Compliance and Comprehensive Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 54.2
### Description: Update all refactored files to fully comply with .cursorrules and add or complete comment blocks for all public types, methods, and complex logic.
### Details:
Review .cursorrules requirements and apply necessary changes to code style, structure, and documentation. Add or update comment blocks to explain public APIs and intricate logic, ensuring clarity and maintainability.

## 4. Expand or Add Unit and Integration Tests for Refactored Code [pending]
### Dependencies: 54.3
### Description: Update or create unit and integration tests to ensure all refactored code is thoroughly tested and functionality is preserved.
### Details:
Analyze existing test coverage and add or expand tests as needed to cover new or modified logic. Use Swift testing frameworks to implement robust test cases, ensuring no regressions.

## 5. Log Changes, Update Documentation, and Commit Frequently [pending]
### Dependencies: 54.4
### Description: Maintain a detailed changelog of all modifications, update any relevant documentation, and commit changes frequently to preserve a clear history.
### Details:
Document all changes in a changelog file, update README and other relevant docs to reflect new code structure and usage. Make frequent, descriptive commits to facilitate code review and traceability.
