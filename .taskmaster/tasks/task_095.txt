# Task ID: 95
# Title: Implement MVP Navigation and Core Views with Best Practices
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the MVP's left-hand sidebar navigation, CMD+Q support, and core views (Settings, Profile, Dashboard) following platform best practices.
# Details:
Break down the implementation into granular, testable subtasks: (1) Design and build a responsive left-hand sidebar navigation component that allows users to switch between Dashboard, Profile, and Settings views; (2) Implement the Dashboard view with placeholder content and ensure it loads as the default route; (3) Develop the Profile view with basic user information display; (4) Build the Settings view with essential configuration options; (5) Integrate CMD+Q (or platform-appropriate quit shortcut) support, ensuring the app handles quit events gracefully and prompts for unsaved changes if necessary. Follow accessibility and usability best practices throughout. Ensure all components are modular and ready for future expansion. Prioritize these features for MVP delivery, and document any assumptions or limitations encountered.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the sidebar navigation is visible, accessible, and allows seamless switching between Dashboard, Profile, and Settings views. Confirm that CMD+Q (or equivalent) triggers the appropriate quit behavior and handles unsaved changes correctly. Test each view independently to ensure correct rendering, navigation, and responsiveness. Conduct accessibility checks (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility) and confirm all MVP requirements are met. Review code for modularity and adherence to best practices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Responsive Sidebar Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a modular, accessible left-hand sidebar navigation component that allows users to switch between Dashboard, Profile, and Settings views. Ensure the sidebar is responsive and follows platform best practices for usability and accessibility.
### Details:
Use wireframes or design tools to map the sidebar layout. Implement navigation logic using a router or state management system. Ensure keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, and screen reader compatibility. Structure the sidebar for easy expansion with future views.

## 2. Develop Dashboard View with Default Routing [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.1
### Description: Implement the Dashboard view with placeholder content and configure it to load as the default route when the application starts.
### Details:
Create a Dashboard component with basic placeholder elements. Set up routing so that the Dashboard is the initial view. Ensure the view is modular and ready for future content expansion.

## 3. Build Profile View for User Information Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.1
### Description: Develop the Profile view to display basic user information, ensuring the component is accessible and follows best practices for passive views in MVP architecture.
### Details:
Implement a Profile component that receives user data via props or state. Keep the view logic minimal, delegating data handling to the presenter/controller. Ensure accessibility for all displayed information.

## 4. Implement Settings View with Essential Configuration Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.1
### Description: Create the Settings view, providing essential configuration options for the user. Ensure the view is modular, accessible, and ready for future settings expansion.
### Details:
Design a Settings component with basic configuration controls (e.g., toggles, dropdowns). Follow accessibility guidelines for form elements. Structure the component for easy addition of new settings.

## 5. Integrate CMD+Q (or Platform Quit Shortcut) Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.2, 95.3, 95.4
### Description: Add support for CMD+Q (or the platform-appropriate quit shortcut), ensuring the app handles quit events gracefully and prompts the user for unsaved changes if necessary.
### Details:
Detect the quit shortcut using platform APIs or event listeners. Implement logic to check for unsaved changes in any view and prompt the user before quitting. Ensure the quit handling is modular and testable.
