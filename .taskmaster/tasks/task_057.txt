# Task ID: 57
# Title: Refactor AppDelegate.swift for Lifecycle Management, Modularity, and Maintainability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor AppDelegate.swift in the Sandbox project to improve lifecycle management, modularity, and maintainability, targeting over 90% code and problem rating. Expand or add tests, update the comment block, and ensure full alignment with the Corporate Style Guide.
# Details:
Analyze the current AppDelegate.swift implementation and identify areas where responsibilities can be separated using design patterns such as the Composite pattern to delegate lifecycle events to modular subcomponents. Refactor the code to ensure each subcomponent has a single responsibility, making the AppDelegate concise and easier to maintain. Update the comment block at the top of the file to reflect the new structure and document key responsibilities, following the Corporate Style Guide for formatting and language. Ensure all code changes are modular, testable, and maintainable, and that the file adheres to all corporate coding standards. Where possible, extract reusable logic into separate classes or modules to further improve maintainability and testability. Ensure all public APIs and interfaces are clearly documented.

# Test Strategy:
Write or expand unit and integration tests to cover all AppDelegate lifecycle events and their delegated subcomponents, ensuring at least 90% code coverage. Test that each subcomponent is invoked correctly during the app lifecycle and that responsibilities are properly separated. Validate that the refactored code passes all existing and new tests, and that the comment block and code style fully comply with the Corporate Style Guide. Use static analysis tools to confirm code quality and maintainability targets are met.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze AppDelegate and design Composite pattern structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the current AppDelegate.swift implementation to identify lifecycle events and responsibilities that can be separated using the Composite design pattern.
### Details:
Review the current AppDelegate implementation and identify all lifecycle methods (application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:, applicationWillResignActive:, etc.). Create a protocol that defines these methods, which will serve as the interface for both composite and leaf delegates. Design a composite structure that will allow multiple leaf delegates to handle specific responsibilities while maintaining the single AppDelegate entry point. Document the responsibilities that will be separated into individual components.

## 2. Implement AppDelegateFactory and base protocols [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.1
### Description: Create the foundational protocols and factory class needed to support the Composite pattern implementation.
### Details:
Implement an AppDelegateType protocol that defines all the UIApplicationDelegate methods needed. Create an AppDelegateFactory class that will be responsible for creating and configuring all leaf delegates. Implement a CompositeAppDelegate class that will hold references to all leaf delegates and forward lifecycle method calls to them. Ensure each component follows single responsibility principle and is individually testable.

## 3. Implement specialized leaf AppDelegate components [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.2
### Description: Create individual leaf AppDelegate components, each with a single responsibility.
### Details:
Based on the analysis from subtask 1, implement separate leaf AppDelegate classes for each responsibility area (e.g., AnalyticsAppDelegate, PushNotificationsAppDelegate, CoreDataAppDelegate, etc.). Each leaf delegate should implement the AppDelegateType protocol and handle only its specific responsibility. Extract existing code from the original AppDelegate into these new components, ensuring clean separation of concerns. Make each component easily testable in isolation.

## 4. Refactor main AppDelegate to use the Composite pattern [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.3
### Description: Modify the main AppDelegate.swift file to use the new composite structure and delegate components.
### Details:
Refactor the main AppDelegate class to create and use the CompositeAppDelegate. Use the AppDelegateFactory to create all required leaf delegates and register them with the composite. Remove all code that has been moved to leaf delegates. Ensure the main AppDelegate remains clean and focused solely on coordinating the composite pattern. Update the file's comment block to reflect the new architecture and document key responsibilities following the Corporate Style Guide.

## 5. Validate against Corporate Style Guide and optimize for testability [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.4
### Description: Ensure all refactored code adheres to the Corporate Style Guide and is optimized for testability and maintainability.
### Details:
Review all refactored code to ensure compliance with the Corporate Style Guide for formatting, naming conventions, and documentation. Add or update XML documentation comments for all public APIs and interfaces. Verify that each component has a single responsibility and is testable in isolation. Identify any remaining areas where code could be further modularized or improved. Create a final documentation overview that explains the new architecture, its benefits, and how to extend it with new functionality in the future.
