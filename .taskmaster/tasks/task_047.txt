# Task ID: 47
# Title: Implement Modular, Professional Dashboard Page as Main App Entry (P0 Feature)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a vibrant, user-focused, and reusable Dashboard page in Sandbox, serving as the main entry point after SSO. Ensure strict compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules, referencing example code and following TDD principles.
# Details:
Design and implement a modular Dashboard page that acts as the primary landing experience post-SSO authentication. The Dashboard must be visually engaging, intuitive, and tailored to user needs, following best practices for dashboard design: clarify user goals, display only essential and actionable information, and group related metrics for clarity. Use interactive and self-service elements (e.g., filters, collapsible sections) to enhance engagement and usability. Ensure all UI components are reusable and adhere to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules for consistency. Reference existing example code for structure and styling. Architect the page for easy extension and maintenance, with clear separation of concerns and robust state management. Prioritize accessibility and responsiveness across devices. Log this as a high-priority (P0) feature task.

# Test Strategy:
Adopt a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow: write comprehensive unit and UI tests before implementation, covering all Dashboard modules, user flows, and interactive features. Validate compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules through automated style checks and peer review. Test SSO integration to ensure the Dashboard is only accessible post-authentication. Verify responsiveness, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and cross-browser compatibility. Conduct user acceptance testing with representative users to confirm the Dashboard is vibrant, user-focused, and meets business objectives.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Dashboard Goals, User Needs, and Content Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Clarify the primary objectives of the dashboard, identify key user personas and their goals, and determine the essential metrics and actionable information to display. Establish a content hierarchy and group related metrics for clarity, referencing best practices and example code.
### Details:
Conduct stakeholder interviews or review requirements to understand user needs. Use the S.M.A.R.T. framework to set specific, measurable goals. Draft a content outline grouping related metrics and actionable elements. Reference the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules for initial planning.

## 2. Design Modular, Reusable UI Components Aligned with Style Guide [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.1
### Description: Design and implement modular, reusable UI components for the dashboard, ensuring strict adherence to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Components should support accessibility, responsiveness, and easy extension.
### Details:
Create a component library (e.g., cards, charts, filters, collapsible sections) using example code as reference. Ensure all components are accessible (ARIA, keyboard navigation) and responsive. Document component APIs for reuse.

## 3. Implement Dashboard Layout and State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.2
### Description: Compose the dashboard page using the modular components, establishing a clear layout that groups related metrics and supports interactive elements. Architect robust state management for user interactions and data flow.
### Details:
Arrange components according to the defined content hierarchy. Implement state management (e.g., using Redux, Context API, or similar) to handle filters, collapsible sections, and dynamic data updates. Ensure separation of concerns between UI and logic.

## 4. Integrate SSO Entry and Data Sources [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.3
### Description: Connect the dashboard to the SSO authentication flow, ensuring it serves as the main entry point post-login. Integrate required data sources to populate dashboard metrics and visuals.
### Details:
Configure routing so the dashboard is the landing page after SSO. Implement secure data fetching and error handling for all dashboard metrics. Ensure data is loaded efficiently and updates in real time or on user action as needed.

## 5. Conduct TDD-Driven Validation, Accessibility, and Responsiveness Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.4
### Description: Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles throughout implementation. Perform comprehensive testing for accessibility, responsiveness, and adherence to design and style guidelines. Iterate based on feedback.
### Details:
Write tests before implementing features, covering unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios. Use accessibility testing tools and manual checks. Test across devices and browsers for responsiveness. Review with stakeholders for final sign-off.
