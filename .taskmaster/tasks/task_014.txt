# Task ID: 14
# Title: Calendar Synchronization with macOS Calendar
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate with macOS Calendar app for event synchronization.
# Details:
Use macOS Calendar API to sync case-related events. Support two-way sync for event creation and updates. Handle conflicts and permissions.

# Test Strategy:
Test event sync in both directions. Verify conflict handling and permissions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and Configure macOS Calendar API Access [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Investigate and set up access to the macOS Calendar (EventKit) API, ensuring all necessary permissions and authentication (such as app-specific passwords and two-factor authentication) are in place.
### Details:
Review Apple’s EventKit documentation to understand required entitlements and permissions. Configure the development environment to access user calendar data, including handling app-specific passwords and enabling two-factor authentication as needed.

## 2. Implement Event Data Retrieval and Parsing [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop functionality to fetch and parse events from the macOS Calendar, mapping them to the application's case-related event model.
### Details:
Use EventKit APIs to retrieve events from the user’s calendars. Parse event data and map relevant fields (title, time, description, attendees) to the internal data structures used for case-related events.

## 3. Develop Two-Way Event Synchronization Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Implement logic to synchronize event creation and updates between the application and macOS Calendar, supporting both push (to Calendar) and pull (from Calendar) operations.
### Details:
Create synchronization routines that detect new or updated events in both systems and propagate changes accordingly. Ensure that event IDs or unique identifiers are used to track synchronized items.

## 4. Handle Conflict Resolution and Data Consistency [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Design and implement mechanisms to detect and resolve conflicts when the same event is modified in both systems, ensuring data consistency.
### Details:
Implement conflict detection based on timestamps or versioning. Define rules for resolving conflicts (e.g., latest update wins, user prompt). Log all conflict occurrences for audit and debugging.

## 5. Implement and Test User Permission Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Ensure robust handling of user permissions for calendar access, including requesting, verifying, and gracefully handling denied or revoked permissions.
### Details:
Integrate permission checks throughout the synchronization workflow. Provide clear user prompts and error handling for denied or revoked permissions. Ensure compliance with Apple’s privacy guidelines.
