# Task ID: 56
# Title: Refactor ContentView.swift for Navigation, Modularity, and UI/UX Enhancement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor ContentView.swift in the Sandbox project to improve navigation, modularity, and user experience, targeting over 90% code and problem rating. Expand or add tests, update the comment block, and ensure full alignment with the Corporate Style Guide.
# Details:
Break down ContentView.swift by extracting logical subviews into separate structs conforming to View, moving reusable components to their own files where appropriate. Refactor navigation logic to use modern SwiftUI navigation patterns (e.g., NavigationStack, NavigationLink) for clarity and maintainability. Simplify and modularize UI code by leveraging techniques such as computed properties, Groups, and reusable view components, ensuring each subview is decoupled from specific models where possible. Update the file's comment block to reflect the new structure and intent, and review all code for adherence to the Corporate Style Guide, including naming, formatting, and documentation standards. Ensure all changes maintain or improve accessibility and responsiveness.

# Test Strategy:
Review code coverage and problem rating metrics to confirm both exceed 90%. Expand or add unit and UI tests for all new and refactored components, including navigation flows and edge cases. Manually verify that navigation works as intended, UI/UX improvements are present, and the app remains accessible and responsive on all supported devices. Confirm that all code and comments align with the Corporate Style Guide through peer review or automated linting tools.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extract Logical Subviews into Separate Structs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and extract logical UI components from ContentView.swift into separate View structs to improve code organization and readability.
### Details:
Analyze ContentView.swift to identify distinct UI sections that can be extracted as separate View structs. Create new structs that conform to the View protocol for each logical component. Move relevant state variables and computed properties to these new structs, passing only necessary data through initializer parameters. Use @Binding for any values that need to be modified by the subview. Ensure each extracted view follows single responsibility principle and has a clear, focused purpose.

## 2. Move Reusable Components to Separate Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 56.1
### Description: Relocate reusable view components to dedicated files to promote code reuse and maintainability across the application.
### Details:
Identify components from the extracted views that could be reused elsewhere in the application. Create new Swift files for each reusable component, ensuring they follow the Corporate Style Guide naming conventions. Implement these components with flexible parameters to accommodate various use cases. Update import statements in ContentView.swift and other files as needed. Consider using ViewModifiers for styling that needs to be applied consistently across multiple views.

## 3. Implement Modern SwiftUI Navigation Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 56.1, 56.2
### Description: Refactor navigation logic to use NavigationStack and NavigationLink for improved clarity and maintainability.
### Details:
Replace any outdated navigation approaches with NavigationStack at the root level. Convert existing navigation links to use the new NavigationLink API with destinations and value-based navigation where appropriate. Implement programmatic navigation using NavigationPath for complex flows. Extract navigation-related logic into dedicated methods or computed properties to keep the view body clean. Ensure proper state management for navigation to prevent unintended navigation behavior.

## 4. Simplify and Modularize UI Code [pending]
### Dependencies: 56.1, 56.2, 56.3
### Description: Refactor UI code using computed properties, Groups, and other SwiftUI techniques to improve readability and maintainability.
### Details:
Replace complex conditional rendering in view body with computed properties that return appropriate views. Use Group to organize related view elements without introducing additional container views. Implement @ViewBuilder for complex view construction logic. Extract repetitive styling into extension methods or ViewModifiers. Decouple views from specific models by accepting only the data they need rather than entire model objects. Use appropriate container views (VStack, HStack, etc.) to create a clear visual hierarchy.

## 5. Update Documentation and Ensure Style Guide Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 56.1, 56.2, 56.3, 56.4
### Description: Update file comments, inline documentation, and ensure all code adheres to the Corporate Style Guide standards.
### Details:
Update the file's comment block to reflect the new structure and purpose of ContentView.swift. Add comprehensive documentation for all public methods, properties, and types using the standard documentation format. Review naming conventions for consistency with the Corporate Style Guide (e.g., camelCase for properties, PascalCase for types). Check formatting including indentation, line spacing, and bracket placement. Verify accessibility by ensuring all UI elements have appropriate labels and traits. Run SwiftLint or similar tools to catch any style violations.
