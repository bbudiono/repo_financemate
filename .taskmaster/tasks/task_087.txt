# Task ID: 87
# Title: Implement Navigation Modal/UI Across Key Pages for MVP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and integrate a consistent, accessible navigation modal/UI component across all primary pages to support MVP navigation requirements.
# Details:
Design and implement a reusable navigation modal component that overlays the current screen, providing users with clear, concise navigation options to all key pages. Ensure the modal is easily dismissible via a close button and keyboard (Escape key), and supports keyboard navigation for accessibility. Follow best practices by keeping modal content simple, avoiding nested modals, and ensuring the modal does not disrupt the underlying navigation stack. Integrate the modal into the root navigation structure (e.g., using React Navigation's modal pattern) and ensure it is available on all MVP-critical pages. The modal should be responsive, visually distinct, and provide immediate feedback for user actions. Coordinate with design to ensure UI consistency and clarity. Document the modal's usage and integration points for future development.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the modal appears and functions correctly on all key MVP pages. Test that the modal can be opened and closed via UI controls and keyboard shortcuts (Escape key). Ensure all navigation links within the modal route to the correct pages and that the modal is dismissed upon navigation. Confirm accessibility by tabbing through modal elements and activating them via keyboard. Check that the modal does not interfere with the underlying navigation stack or introduce navigation bugs. Perform cross-device and cross-browser testing to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Modal UI Requirements and Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Collaborate with design to finalize the navigation modal's layout, content, and visual style. Ensure the design is simple, visually distinct, and aligns with MVP navigation needs. Specify accessibility requirements, including keyboard navigation and focus management.
### Details:
Work closely with designers to create wireframes or mockups. Document required navigation options, modal triggers, close mechanisms, and responsive behaviors. Confirm accessibility features such as keyboard support and ARIA roles.

## 2. Implement Reusable Navigation Modal Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 87.1
### Description: Develop the navigation modal as a reusable component, following best practices for modal overlays. Ensure it is easily dismissible via a close button and Escape key, and supports keyboard navigation and focus management.
### Details:
Use React Navigation's modal pattern at the root stack level to avoid nesting issues. Implement focus trapping, ARIA attributes, and ensure the modal is responsive. Modal content should be concise and avoid nested modals. Ensure the modal does not disrupt the underlying navigation stack.[1][2][5]

## 3. Integrate Modal into Root Navigation Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 87.2
### Description: Integrate the modal component into the application's root navigation stack so it can be triggered from all MVP-critical pages.
### Details:
Register the modal in the root navigator (e.g., using React Navigation's modal group). Ensure modal triggers are available on all key pages and that navigation actions from within the modal work as expected.[1][4]

## 4. Ensure Accessibility and Responsive Behavior [pending]
### Dependencies: 87.3
### Description: Validate and enhance the modal for accessibility and responsiveness. Confirm keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA roles, and screen reader compatibility. Test on various devices and screen sizes.
### Details:
Use accessibility testing tools to verify ARIA attributes, focus trapping, and keyboard shortcuts. Manually test with screen readers and on different devices. Adjust styles for mobile and desktop responsiveness.[5]

## 5. Document Modal Usage and Integration Points [pending]
### Dependencies: 87.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the modal component, including usage guidelines, integration steps, accessibility considerations, and customization options.
### Details:
Write clear documentation for developers on how to use and extend the modal. Include code examples, accessibility notes, and integration instructions for future development.
