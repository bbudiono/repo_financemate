# Task ID: 45
# Title: Implement Modular, Professional Settings Page with User Preferences, Account Management, and SSO (P0 Feature)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a modular, reusable Settings page in Sandbox that supports user preferences, account management, and SSO settings, fully compliant with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Reference example code and ensure TDD throughout implementation.
# Details:
Design the Settings page with a clear, intuitive information architecture, grouping settings into logical categories such as User Preferences, Account Management, and SSO. Ensure modularity and reusability by structuring components for easy extension and maintenance. Adhere strictly to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules for all UI elements, typography, spacing, and interactions. Reference existing example code for best practices and consistency. Collaborate early with stakeholders and customer support to identify required settings and pain points. Prioritize quick, prominent access to the Settings page within the app. Use plain language for labels and concise descriptions for each setting. Implement default values and clear feedback for user actions. Ensure accessibility and responsiveness across devices. All code must be written using TDD, with comprehensive unit and UI tests developed in parallel.

# Test Strategy:
Adopt a strict TDD workflow: write tests for each component and feature before implementation. Verify that all settings categories (User Preferences, Account Management, SSO) are present, functional, and visually compliant with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Test for accessibility (a11y), responsiveness, and usability. Ensure all settings changes persist and provide immediate, clear feedback. Review modularity and reusability of components through code review. Validate that the page is easily accessible from the main interface. Confirm all requirements with stakeholders and customer support. Achieve 100% test coverage for new code, including edge cases and error states.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Gather Requirements and Define Settings Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Collaborate with stakeholders and customer support to identify all required settings, pain points, and user needs. Design a clear, intuitive information architecture that logically groups settings into User Preferences, Account Management, and SSO categories.
### Details:
Conduct interviews or workshops with stakeholders and customer support. Document all required settings and their intended behaviors. Create a sitemap or wireframe outlining the structure and navigation of the Settings page, ensuring quick and prominent access within the app.

## 2. Design Modular, Reusable UI Components Aligned with Corporate Style Guide [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1
### Description: Design and document modular UI components for each settings category, ensuring strict adherence to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules for all UI elements, typography, spacing, and interactions.
### Details:
Break down the Settings page into reusable components (e.g., section containers, input fields, toggles, feedback messages). Reference example code for best practices. Use consistent naming and structure for components to maximize reusability and maintainability. Document component interfaces and usage guidelines.

## 3. Implement Settings Page and Components Using TDD [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.2
### Description: Develop the Settings page and all modular components using test-driven development (TDD), ensuring each component is independently testable and reusable.
### Details:
Write unit and UI tests for each component before implementation. Implement components and assemble the Settings page according to the defined architecture. Ensure all code is modular, future-proof, and references example code for consistency.

## 4. Integrate User Preferences, Account Management, and SSO Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.3
### Description: Connect the modular components to backend services or APIs to enable full functionality for user preferences, account management, and SSO settings, including default values and clear feedback for user actions.
### Details:
Implement API calls or state management for each settings category. Ensure settings are persisted and retrieved correctly. Provide clear, accessible feedback for user actions (e.g., save, error, success). Use plain language for labels and concise descriptions.

## 5. Ensure Accessibility, Responsiveness, and Final QA [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.4
### Description: Verify that the Settings page and all components are fully accessible, responsive across devices, and meet all quality standards. Conduct final QA and stakeholder review.
### Details:
Perform accessibility audits (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast). Test responsiveness on multiple devices and browsers. Conduct end-to-end tests and gather stakeholder feedback for final adjustments.
