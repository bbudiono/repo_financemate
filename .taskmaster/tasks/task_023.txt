# Task ID: 23
# Title: Audit and Refactor Low-Quality Code per .cursorrules Standards
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Identify, audit, and refactor all code in the FinanceMate project rated below 70% by the .cursorrules system, raising quality to above 90% while ensuring documentation, testing, and adherence to the Canonical Swift Development Process.
# Details:
1. Perform a comprehensive code quality audit across the entire FinanceMate codebase using the .cursorrules rating system, generating a detailed report of all files and code sections rated below 70%.
2. Catalog each low-rated file/section, including location, current rating, and specific issues identified by .cursorrules.
3. Develop a prioritized refactoring plan, ranking targets by severity, impact, and dependencies.
4. Refactor each identified code section to achieve a quality rating above 90%, ensuring all changes strictly follow the Canonical Swift Development Process as outlined in Section 8.2 of .cursorrules.
5. Update or add documentation and tests for all refactored code, ensuring code style, clarity, and maintainability.
6. Validate that all refactored code maintains original functionality and passes all existing and new tests.
7. Integrate changes incrementally, using code reviews and CI/CD checks to enforce .cursorrules compliance and prevent regressions.

# Test Strategy:
- Run the .cursorrules code quality analysis before and after refactoring to confirm all previously low-rated code now exceeds 90%.
- Review the audit report to ensure all <70% sections were addressed and refactored.
- Verify that all refactored code is documented, tested, and adheres to the Canonical Swift Development Process (Section 8.2).
- Ensure all unit, integration, and regression tests pass with no loss of functionality.
- Conduct peer code reviews to confirm code style, clarity, and .cursorrules compliance.
- Check CI/CD pipelines for successful builds and automated quality gate enforcement.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit Codebase Using .cursorrules and Generate Low-Quality Report [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run the .cursorrules system across the entire FinanceMate codebase to identify all files and code sections rated below 70%. Generate a detailed report listing each low-rated file/section, its location, current rating, and specific issues flagged by .cursorrules.
### Details:
Use the .cursorrules CLI or integration to scan the codebase. Export results to a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON) capturing file paths, line numbers, ratings, and rule violations. Ensure the report is comprehensive and up to date.

## 2. Catalog and Analyze Low-Quality Code Sections [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Catalog each low-rated file/section from the audit, documenting its location, current rating, and the specific issues identified. Analyze the issues to understand root causes and group similar problems for efficient remediation.
### Details:
Create a catalog (spreadsheet or database) with columns for file, section, rating, and issue details. Tag issues by type (e.g., readability, structure, documentation, test coverage) to facilitate prioritization.

## 3. Develop Prioritized Refactoring Plan [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Develop a refactoring plan that prioritizes low-quality code sections based on severity, impact, and dependencies. Sequence the work to address critical or high-impact areas first and resolve dependencies between code sections.
### Details:
Assign priority levels to each cataloged issue. Map dependencies (e.g., shared modules, cross-cutting concerns) and create a step-by-step plan for refactoring. Document the plan for team review.

## 4. Refactor Code to Meet .cursorrules and Canonical Swift Standards [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.3
### Description: Refactor each identified low-quality code section to achieve a .cursorrules rating above 90%, strictly following the Canonical Swift Development Process and Section 8.2 of .cursorrules. Ensure code is readable, maintainable, and adheres to best practices.
### Details:
Apply refactoring iteratively, focusing on readability, structure, and maintainability. Use the latest Swift and SwiftUI features, avoid anti-patterns, and ensure all changes are correct, secure, and efficient. Re-run .cursorrules after each refactor to confirm compliance.

## 5. Update Documentation, Add/Revise Tests, and Validate Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.4
### Description: Update or add documentation and tests for all refactored code. Ensure code style, clarity, and maintainability. Validate that all refactored code maintains original functionality and passes all existing and new tests. Integrate changes incrementally with code reviews and CI/CD checks to enforce .cursorrules compliance.
### Details:
Write or revise inline comments, API docs, and usage guides as needed. Add or update unit and integration tests to cover refactored code. Run the full test suite and CI/CD pipeline to ensure no regressions. Use code reviews to enforce standards and .cursorrules compliance.
