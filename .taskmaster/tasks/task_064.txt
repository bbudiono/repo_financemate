# Task ID: 64
# Title: Refactor Non-Concurrent Async Call in AuthViewModel.swift
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the function at line 179 in AuthViewModel.swift to properly support asynchronous operations and resolve the warning: ''async' call in a function that does not support concurrency'.
# Details:
Identify the function at line 179 in AuthViewModel.swift that is making an 'async' call without being marked as 'async' or running within a concurrent context. Refactor the function by either marking it as 'async' and updating its call sites accordingly, or by wrapping the 'async' call within a Task or Task.detached block if the function cannot be made asynchronous. Ensure that structured concurrency principles are followed, handle any potential errors or cancellations, and update related documentation and tests. Review the function's usage throughout the codebase to prevent cascading async requirements unless necessary, and consider breaking down complex logic into smaller, manageable async tasks if appropriate.[1][2][3]

# Test Strategy:
1. Confirm that the warning is no longer present after refactoring. 2. Run all unit and integration tests related to AuthViewModel to ensure no regressions or runtime issues. 3. Manually test authentication flows that trigger the affected function, verifying correct asynchronous behavior and error handling. 4. Review code to ensure structured concurrency best practices are followed and that no unnecessary async propagation has occurred.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify and Analyze the Target Function [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Locate the function at line 179 in AuthViewModel.swift that is making an 'async' call without proper concurrency support. Analyze its logic, parameters, and how it is currently invoked throughout the codebase.
### Details:
Open AuthViewModel.swift and review the function at line 179. Document its signature, purpose, and all instances where it is called. Note whether it can be safely marked as 'async' or if it must remain synchronous due to call site constraints.

## 2. Determine Appropriate Refactoring Approach [pending]
### Dependencies: 64.1
### Description: Decide whether to mark the function as 'async' and propagate changes to its call sites, or to wrap the async call within a Task or Task.detached block if the function must remain synchronous.
### Details:
Evaluate the impact of making the function 'async' on the call stack. If cascading async is not feasible, plan to use Task or Task.detached for fire-and-forget execution, following Swift concurrency best practices[1][2].

## 3. Implement Refactoring and Structured Concurrency [pending]
### Dependencies: 64.2
### Description: Refactor the function according to the chosen approach: update its signature and call sites if marking as 'async', or wrap the async call in a Task if not. Ensure structured concurrency and proper error/cancellation handling.
### Details:
Modify the function and its call sites as needed. If using Task, ensure error handling and cancellation logic are implemented. Follow Swift's structured concurrency principles to avoid resource leaks and maintain code clarity[1][3].

## 4. Update Documentation and Code Comments [pending]
### Dependencies: 64.3
### Description: Document the changes made to the function, including its new concurrency behavior, error handling, and any implications for callers.
### Details:
Update inline comments, function documentation, and any related developer guides to reflect the new async/concurrent behavior. Clearly explain any changes to usage or error/cancellation semantics.

## 5. Review and Test Function Usage Across Codebase [pending]
### Dependencies: 64.4
### Description: Audit all usages of the refactored function to ensure compatibility and prevent unintended cascading async requirements. Refactor additional call sites if necessary and ensure comprehensive test coverage.
### Details:
Search the codebase for all references to the function. Update any missed call sites and verify that no new concurrency warnings are introduced. Add or update tests to cover all usage scenarios, including edge cases.
