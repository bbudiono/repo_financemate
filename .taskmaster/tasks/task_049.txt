# Task ID: 49
# Title: Implement Modular, Professional About Us Page (P0 Feature)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a modular, reusable, and visually engaging About Us page in Sandbox, presenting company/app information and support links, fully aligned with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Reference example code and follow TDD principles throughout implementation.
# Details:
Design and implement an About Us page as a standalone, reusable module within Sandbox. The page must include concise company/app summaries, mission statement, team highlights, and support/contact links. Integrate compelling headlines, strong branding, and engaging visuals (e.g., team photos, awards, trust badges) to build trust and humanize the brand. Ensure all UI elements, typography, and color schemes strictly adhere to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Reference approved example code for structure and style consistency. Architect the page for easy extensibility and reuse in other contexts. All code must be written using TDD, with clear separation of concerns and modular components for maintainability. Log this as a high-priority (P0) feature task.

# Test Strategy:
Adopt a test-driven development workflow: write comprehensive unit and UI tests before implementation, covering all components, user flows, and edge cases. Validate that all content, visuals, and support links render correctly and are accessible. Verify strict compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules through automated style checks and peer review. Confirm modularity and reusability by integrating the About Us module in at least one additional context. Ensure all tests pass in CI and document test coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create modular component architecture for About Us page [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the foundational component architecture for the About Us page following modular design principles
### Details:
Establish a module-based design system with reusable components that will form the About Us page. Define the core structure including header, content sections, and footer. Create a component library with elements like headings, paragraphs, buttons, and image containers that can be reused across the page and potentially elsewhere. Ensure all components follow the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules for consistency. Set up the testing framework for TDD implementation.

## 2. Implement company information and mission statement modules [pending]

### Description: Develop the modular sections for company information, app summaries, and mission statement with appropriate styling
### Details:
Create reusable content modules for company information, app summaries, and mission statement. Design these modules with compelling headlines and strong branding elements. Implement typography and color schemes according to the Corporate Style Guide. Ensure each module can function independently and be easily rearranged or reused. Reference approved example code for structural guidance while maintaining the modular approach.

## 3. Develop team highlights and visual elements modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 49.1
### Description: Create modular components for team information and visual elements like photos, awards, and trust badges
### Details:
Implement reusable modules for team member profiles, company achievements, awards, and trust badges. Design these visual elements to humanize the brand while maintaining professional appearance. Create a consistent visual language for all image-based components. Ensure all visual elements are optimized for performance and responsive across devices. Follow the Corporate Style Guide for spacing, borders, and visual treatments.

## 4. Implement support and contact links module [pending]
### Dependencies: 49.1
### Description: Develop a reusable module for support resources and contact information with interactive elements
### Details:
Create a comprehensive support and contact module that includes links to help resources, contact forms, and social media. Implement interactive elements like buttons and form inputs according to the Corporate Style Guide. Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate hover states, focus indicators, and accessibility attributes. Design the module to be easily maintained and updated with new support resources.

## 5. Integrate and test complete About Us page in Sandbox [pending]
### Dependencies: 49.2, 49.3, 49.4
### Description: Assemble all modules into a cohesive About Us page and perform comprehensive testing in the Sandbox environment
### Details:
Integrate all previously developed modules into a complete, cohesive About Us page. Ensure proper layout and spacing between modules. Implement responsive behavior for the entire page. Verify all components work together harmoniously while maintaining their modular nature. Document the implementation approach and how to reuse components in other contexts. Ensure the final implementation fully aligns with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules.
