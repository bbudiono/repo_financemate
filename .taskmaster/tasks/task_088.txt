# Task ID: 88
# Title: Implement Email/Password Sign Up with Free Authentication Service for MVP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and integrate a secure email/password sign-up flow using a free authentication provider, enabling users to create accounts and access the app for the MVP.
# Details:
1. Select a free authentication service (such as Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, or SuperTokens) that supports email/password sign-up and is compatible with the current tech stack.
2. Set up the authentication provider in the project, including necessary SDK installation and configuration (API keys, environment variables, etc.).
3. Create a user registration UI component with fields for email and password, including client-side validation for email format and password strength.
4. Implement backend logic or use the provider's SDK to handle account creation, securely storing credentials and handling errors (e.g., duplicate email, weak password).
5. Display clear feedback to users on registration success or failure, and handle edge cases (e.g., network errors, invalid input).
6. Ensure that a new user is automatically authenticated and redirected to the appropriate page after successful sign-up.
7. Document the integration steps and any configuration required for local and production environments.

# Test Strategy:
- Verify that the sign-up form renders correctly and enforces client-side validation for email and password fields.
- Test successful account creation with valid credentials and confirm the user is authenticated and redirected appropriately.
- Attempt to register with invalid emails, weak passwords, and duplicate emails to ensure proper error handling and messaging.
- Check that user credentials are securely handled and not exposed in client logs or network requests.
- Review documentation to ensure setup steps are clear and reproducible for other developers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Select and Configure Free Authentication Provider [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research and choose a free authentication service (e.g., Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, Clerk, or SuperTokens) that supports email/password sign-up and is compatible with the current tech stack. Set up the provider in the project, including SDK installation, API key setup, and environment variable configuration.
### Details:
Evaluate available providers for compatibility, documentation, and ease of integration. Follow the provider's setup guide to register the app, obtain credentials, and configure environment variables for both local and production environments.

## 2. Design and Implement User Registration UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 88.1
### Description: Create a user registration form with fields for email and password. Implement client-side validation for email format and password strength according to best practices and provider requirements.
### Details:
Build a responsive UI component for sign-up. Use regex or validation libraries to enforce email format and password rules (e.g., minimum length, character requirements). Display inline validation feedback to users.

## 3. Integrate Sign-Up Logic with Authentication Provider [pending]
### Dependencies: 88.2
### Description: Connect the registration UI to the authentication provider's SDK or API to handle account creation. Ensure secure handling of credentials and implement error handling for cases like duplicate emails or weak passwords.
### Details:
Use the provider's sign-up method to create new accounts. Handle and display errors returned by the provider (e.g., email already in use, password too weak). Ensure credentials are transmitted securely (e.g., over HTTPS).

## 4. Implement Post-Sign-Up Authentication and Redirection [pending]
### Dependencies: 88.3
### Description: Ensure that users are automatically authenticated upon successful registration and redirected to the appropriate page within the app.
### Details:
Leverage the authentication provider's session management to keep users signed in after registration. Implement logic to redirect authenticated users to a dashboard or welcome page.

## 5. Document Integration and Edge Case Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 88.4
### Description: Document all integration steps, configuration requirements, and edge case handling for both local and production environments. Include instructions for error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
### Details:
Write clear setup and usage documentation covering provider configuration, environment variables, and any custom logic. Document how errors are handled and what feedback is shown to users.
