# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Unit Tests for .cursorrules-Compliant Sandbox Files (P0 Test Task)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 39
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop or update modular, maintainable unit tests for all Sandbox code files refactored for .cursorrules compliance in Task #39, ensuring >90% code quality and complexity ratings. Log this as a P0 test task and link to Task #39.
# Details:
Review all Sandbox source files updated in Task #39 for .cursorrules compliance. For each file, implement or refactor unit tests to achieve over 90% code coverage, focusing on modularity, maintainability, and adherence to TDD principles. Ensure tests are isolated, deterministic, and follow best practices such as the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern, descriptive naming, and single-scenario coverage per test. Avoid infrastructure dependencies and ensure tests validate both expected behavior and error handling. Maintain clear linkage to Task #39 for traceability. Document any gaps or challenges encountered during test implementation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all refactored Sandbox files have corresponding unit tests with >90% code coverage using automated coverage tools. Review test code for modularity, maintainability, and compliance with TDD and unit testing best practices (e.g., AAA pattern, descriptive naming, isolation). Confirm that tests are deterministic and cover both normal and edge/error cases. Ensure all tests pass in CI, and cross-reference with Task #39 to confirm full coverage of all updated files.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze .cursorrules compliance and create test plan [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review all Sandbox files updated in Task #39 and create a comprehensive test plan that maps each file to required test coverage areas based on .cursorrules compliance requirements.
### Details:
Examine each Sandbox file modified in Task #39, document their .cursorrules compliance changes, and create a detailed test plan that identifies critical test scenarios, edge cases, and error conditions for each file. The plan should include a coverage matrix mapping each function/method to specific test cases needed to achieve >90% code coverage.

## 2. Implement core unit tests following AAA pattern [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Develop the first batch of unit tests for core functionality in the Sandbox files, strictly adhering to the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and ensuring test isolation.
### Details:
For each Sandbox file, implement unit tests for the primary/core functions first. Structure each test with clear separation between setup (Arrange), execution (Act), and verification (Assert) phases. Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario being tested and expected outcome. Ensure tests are isolated by using mocks for external dependencies and avoiding shared state between tests.

## 3. Develop error handling and edge case tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2
### Description: Create specialized tests that verify proper error handling and edge case behavior for all Sandbox files, ensuring robustness under unexpected conditions.
### Details:
Extend the test suite with tests specifically targeting error conditions, boundary values, and edge cases. Verify that error messages are appropriate, exceptions are properly thrown and caught, and the system degrades gracefully under unexpected inputs. Include tests for null/undefined values, empty collections, maximum/minimum values, and other boundary conditions relevant to each function.

## 4. Implement integration tests for module interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2, 40.3
### Description: Create integration tests that verify correct interactions between modules and components within the Sandbox codebase, while maintaining test isolation principles.
### Details:
Develop integration tests that verify the correct interaction between different modules in the Sandbox codebase. Focus on testing API contracts and ensuring that modules interact correctly according to their interfaces. Use controlled test environments to maintain deterministic test results. Document any discovered integration issues or inconsistencies between modules.

## 5. Measure test coverage and refine test suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2, 40.3, 40.4
### Description: Analyze test coverage metrics, identify gaps, and refine the test suite to exceed 90% code coverage while ensuring high-quality, maintainable tests.
### Details:
Run code coverage analysis tools to identify areas with insufficient test coverage. Implement additional tests to address coverage gaps, focusing on complex or high-risk code sections. Refactor tests to improve maintainability, removing duplication and ensuring consistent patterns. Document any intentionally uncovered code with justification. Prepare a final report linking test coverage to Task #39 deliverables.
