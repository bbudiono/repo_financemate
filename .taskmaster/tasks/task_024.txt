# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Automated UI/UX Validation and Documentation per .cursorrules Section 8.3
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up and enhance automated UI/UX validation, snapshotting, OCR, and documentation systems to comply with Section 8.3 of the .cursorrules document, ensuring accessibility and continuous validation integration.
# Details:
1. Review Section 8.3 and 8.3.4 of the .cursorrules document to extract all UI/UX validation and documentation requirements. 2. Set up and configure tooling for UI snapshotting (e.g., Detox, Appium, or XCUITest) and OCR validation (e.g., Tesseract or Google Vision API), ensuring compatibility with the project's tech stack. 3. Implement automated navigation tree extraction for the app, generating structured representations (e.g., JSON or XML) of the UI hierarchy for each screen. 4. Develop a system for automated screenshot capture at key navigation points, integrating OCR to validate visible text and UI elements against expected values. 5. Build scripts to automate the entire validation process, including snapshotting, OCR, and navigation tree extraction, with clear logging and error reporting. 6. Ensure all UI components are validated for accessibility (e.g., using axe, Accessibility Inspector, or similar tools), covering color contrast, labels, and keyboard navigation. 7. Create comprehensive UI/UX documentation per Section 8.3.4, including annotated screenshots, navigation trees, OCR results, and accessibility reports. 8. Integrate all validation and documentation steps into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous enforcement and reporting. 9. Provide clear developer instructions for running and extending the validation system.

# Test Strategy:
- Verify that the tooling for snapshotting and OCR is correctly installed and produces accurate results on multiple screens and devices. - Confirm that navigation tree extraction outputs match the app's actual UI structure and are updated as the UI evolves. - Run the automated scripts and ensure screenshots, OCR results, and navigation trees are generated and validated without manual intervention. - Review the generated UI/UX documentation for completeness, clarity, and compliance with Section 8.3.4 requirements. - Use accessibility testing tools to validate that all UI components meet accessibility standards, documenting any issues and their resolution. - Check that the validation and documentation processes run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline and fail builds on validation errors. - Solicit feedback from developers and QA to ensure the system is usable, maintainable, and extensible.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extract UI/UX Validation and Documentation Requirements from .cursorrules Section 8.3 [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Thoroughly review Section 8.3 and 8.3.4 of the .cursorrules document to identify and document all specific requirements for automated UI/UX validation, snapshotting, OCR, accessibility, and documentation.
### Details:
Read and analyze the relevant sections of the .cursorrules document. Create a detailed checklist or requirements document outlining all validation, documentation, and accessibility criteria that must be implemented.

## 2. Set Up and Configure Automated UI Snapshotting and OCR Tooling [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Select, install, and configure appropriate tools for UI snapshotting (e.g., Detox, Appium, XCUITest) and OCR validation (e.g., Tesseract, Google Vision API), ensuring compatibility with the project's tech stack and requirements.
### Details:
Evaluate available tools based on project technology and requirements. Integrate chosen tools into the development environment. Validate tool setup by running basic snapshot and OCR tests on sample screens.

## 3. Implement Automated Navigation Tree Extraction and Structured Output [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Develop or configure a system to automatically extract the navigation tree and UI hierarchy for each app screen, outputting structured representations (e.g., JSON or XML) for documentation and validation.
### Details:
Leverage automation frameworks or custom scripts to traverse the app's navigation and extract the UI hierarchy. Ensure the output format aligns with documentation requirements. Store outputs for later validation and reporting.

## 4. Integrate Automated Screenshot Capture, OCR Validation, and Accessibility Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Develop automation scripts to capture screenshots at key navigation points, perform OCR to validate visible text and UI elements, and run accessibility checks (e.g., color contrast, labels, keyboard navigation) using appropriate tools.
### Details:
Combine snapshotting, OCR, and accessibility tools into a unified workflow. Ensure scripts can be triggered automatically and generate logs and error reports. Validate that all UI components are checked for accessibility compliance.

## 5. Automate Documentation Generation and Integrate Validation into CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Build scripts to automate the generation of comprehensive UI/UX documentation (including annotated screenshots, navigation trees, OCR results, and accessibility reports) and integrate the entire validation process into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous enforcement.
### Details:
Develop documentation templates and automation scripts to compile validation artifacts. Configure CI/CD jobs to run validation and documentation steps on each build, with clear reporting and developer instructions for running and extending the system.
