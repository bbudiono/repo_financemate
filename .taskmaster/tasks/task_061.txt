# Task ID: 61
# Title: Integrate User Authentication API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate a secure user authentication API into the project, enabling sign-up, sign-in, and token-based session management for users.
# Details:
Implement the integration of a user authentication API using a secure protocol such as OAuth 2.0 or a provider-specific SDK (e.g., MSAL, Descope). Update the app’s configuration to include required credentials (client ID, redirect URI, scopes, tenant subdomain) as per the authentication provider’s documentation. Develop Swift networking code to handle authentication flows, including sign-up, sign-in, and token refresh, ensuring secure storage and transmission of credentials and tokens. Refactor authentication-related UI components to interact with the new API, and ensure modularity and maintainability in line with recent refactoring tasks. Consider support for additional authentication methods (e.g., biometrics, social login) if the provider supports them. Document configuration steps and code changes thoroughly, and ensure compliance with the Corporate Style Guide.

# Test Strategy:
Verify successful user sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out flows using the integrated API. Test token acquisition, refresh, and secure storage. Simulate authentication failures (e.g., invalid credentials, expired tokens) and confirm appropriate error handling and user feedback. Ensure all authentication-related UI components interact correctly with the API and maintain modularity. Review code for security best practices and compliance with the Corporate Style Guide. Include unit and integration tests for all authentication logic.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Select and Configure Authentication Provider [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Choose a secure authentication provider (e.g., OAuth 2.0, MSAL, Descope) and update the project configuration with required credentials such as client ID, redirect URI, scopes, and tenant subdomain as per the provider’s documentation.
### Details:
Review provider documentation to gather all necessary configuration parameters. Store sensitive credentials securely using environment variables or a secrets manager. Ensure all configuration aligns with the Corporate Style Guide.

## 2. Implement Authentication Flows in Networking Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 61.1
### Description: Develop Swift networking code to handle user sign-up, sign-in, and token-based session management, including secure token refresh logic.
### Details:
Utilize the provider’s SDK or REST API to implement authentication endpoints. Ensure all credentials and tokens are transmitted over HTTPS and securely stored on-device. Follow best practices for error handling and input validation.

## 3. Refactor Authentication UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 61.2
### Description: Update and modularize authentication-related UI components to interact with the new API, supporting sign-up, sign-in, and session management.
### Details:
Refactor UI to decouple logic from presentation, ensuring maintainability. Integrate UI with networking layer for real-time feedback and error handling. Follow recent refactoring patterns and Corporate Style Guide.

## 4. Integrate Additional Authentication Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 61.3
### Description: Add support for additional authentication methods such as biometrics or social login, if supported by the provider.
### Details:
Review provider capabilities and documentation. Implement additional flows using provider SDKs or APIs, ensuring seamless integration with existing authentication logic.

## 5. Document Integration and Ensure Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 61.4
### Description: Thoroughly document configuration steps, code changes, and usage instructions. Ensure all implementation aligns with the Corporate Style Guide and security best practices.
### Details:
Prepare developer documentation covering setup, configuration, and troubleshooting. Include code samples and highlight security considerations such as secure storage and HTTPS usage.
