# Task ID: 35
# Title: Refactor and Enhance User Model for Modularity, SSO, and Profile Support (P0, .cursorrules §6.4.1)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the Sandbox User model to achieve >90% code quality and problem complexity rating, ensuring modularity, extensibility for Apple/Google SSO, and support for profile data (avatar, editable fields), in full compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1. Implement TDD, comprehensive comments, and update complexity ratings; log as a P0 refactor task.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current User model implementation and identify areas for improvement in modularity, extensibility, and code quality. 2. Refactor the model to use a modular architecture, separating concerns such as authentication, profile data, and SSO integration. 3. Design extensible interfaces or protocols to support future SSO providers (Apple, Google), ensuring minimal coupling and easy addition of new providers. 4. Add support for user profile data, including avatar and editable fields, with clear data validation and update mechanisms. 5. Ensure all changes are fully documented with comprehensive comments, including rationale for architectural decisions and references to .cursorrules §6.4.1. 6. Update code quality and problem complexity ratings to reflect improvements, and ensure the model meets or exceeds the >90% threshold. 7. Follow TDD: write or update unit tests before refactoring, and ensure all new features are covered by tests. 8. Log the task as a P0 refactor in project tracking, referencing .cursorrules and rationale for prioritization.

# Test Strategy:
- Review code quality and complexity metrics to confirm >90% ratings post-refactor. - Verify modularity by ensuring SSO providers can be added or swapped with minimal changes. - Test extensibility by implementing stubs for Apple and Google SSO and confirming integration points. - Validate profile data support by creating, updating, and retrieving avatars and editable fields in unit tests. - Ensure all new and refactored code is covered by comprehensive unit tests, following TDD principles. - Review code comments and documentation for completeness and .cursorrules §6.4.1 compliance. - Confirm that the task is logged as a P0 refactor with appropriate references and rationale.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current User Model and Design Modular Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the existing User model implementation to identify areas for improvement in modularity, extensibility, and code quality. Design a new modular architecture that separates concerns and complies with .cursorrules §6.4.1.
### Details:
1. Document the current User model structure, dependencies, and responsibilities. 2. Identify code quality issues and technical debt. 3. Design a new architecture with clear separation of concerns (authentication, profile data, SSO integration). 4. Create UML diagrams for the new architecture. 5. Define interfaces/protocols for each module. 6. Document architectural decisions with rationale and references to .cursorrules §6.4.1.

## 2. Implement Core User Model with TDD Approach [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Refactor the core User model using Test-Driven Development to ensure high code quality and proper separation of concerns. Focus on the base functionality before adding extensions for SSO and profiles.
### Details:
1. Write failing tests for the core User model functionality. 2. Implement the base User model with clean separation of concerns. 3. Ensure proper encapsulation of data and behavior. 4. Implement data validation mechanisms. 5. Add comprehensive comments explaining implementation details and architectural decisions. 6. Verify >90% code quality metrics for the core implementation.

## 3. Develop SSO Integration Framework for Apple and Google [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2
### Description: Create an extensible SSO integration framework that supports Apple and Google authentication while maintaining loose coupling with the core User model.
### Details:
1. Design and implement provider-agnostic SSO interfaces. 2. Create concrete implementations for Apple and Google SSO. 3. Implement adapter pattern to connect SSO providers with the User model. 4. Ensure the framework allows easy addition of new SSO providers. 5. Document the integration points and extension mechanisms. 6. Implement proper error handling and authentication state management.

## 4. Implement User Profile Data Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2
### Description: Add support for user profile data including avatars and editable fields with proper validation and update mechanisms.
### Details:
1. Define a profile data schema with required and optional fields. 2. Implement avatar storage and retrieval functionality. 3. Create validation rules for all profile fields. 4. Develop update mechanisms that maintain data integrity. 5. Implement proper error handling for invalid data. 6. Add methods for profile data serialization and deserialization. 7. Document all profile fields and validation rules.

## 5. Finalize Documentation, Quality Metrics, and Project Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2, 35.3, 35.4
### Description: Complete all documentation, ensure code quality metrics exceed 90%, update complexity ratings, and log the task properly in the project tracking system.
### Details:
1. Review and enhance code comments throughout the implementation. 2. Generate API documentation for all public interfaces. 3. Update code quality metrics and verify they exceed 90%. 4. Calculate and update problem complexity ratings. 5. Create a comprehensive implementation guide for future developers. 6. Log the task as a P0 refactor in the project tracking system with references to .cursorrules §6.4.1. 7. Prepare a summary of architectural decisions and their rationale.
