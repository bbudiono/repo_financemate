# Task ID: 33
# Title: Refactor AuthViewModel.swift for Code Quality, Modularity, and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor _macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/Sources/ViewModels/AuthViewModel.swift to achieve over 90% code quality and problem rating, with enhanced modularity, robust error handling, comprehensive documentation, and full compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2. Document all changes and rationale.
# Details:
Begin by analyzing the current structure and identifying areas for improvement in code quality, modularity, and error handling. Refactor the code to break down large methods into smaller, reusable functions, and extract any repeated logic into helper methods or extensions where appropriate. Ensure all public methods and complex logic are fully documented with comment blocks, including parameter and return descriptions, usage examples, and rationale for design decisions. Implement robust error handling using Swift best practices, such as using Result types or custom error enums, and ensure all error paths are handled gracefully. Review and update the code to comply strictly with .cursorrules §6.4.1 (modularity, separation of concerns) and §8.2 (documentation standards). Maintain clean commit history with detailed messages explaining each change and the reasoning behind it. At the end, provide a summary document outlining all changes, improvements, and compliance checks.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run static analysis tools (e.g., SwiftLint, SwiftFormat) to verify code quality exceeds 90% and that all linter rules are satisfied. 2. Review code coverage reports to ensure all new and refactored logic is covered by unit tests. 3. Manually inspect comment blocks for completeness and clarity, ensuring all public APIs and complex logic are documented per .cursorrules §8.2. 4. Validate that error handling covers all failure paths and produces meaningful errors. 5. Confirm modularity and separation of concerns by reviewing class and method responsibilities. 6. Review the summary document to ensure all changes and rationales are clearly explained and compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2 is explicitly documented.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current AuthViewModel Structure and Create Refactoring Plan [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the existing AuthViewModel.swift file to identify code quality issues, modularity problems, and areas for improvement.
### Details:
Review the current implementation focusing on large methods, repeated logic, and separation of concerns. Document all issues found including: method sizes, responsibility violations, error handling approaches, and documentation gaps. Create a detailed refactoring plan with specific targets for improvement. Check the file against .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2 requirements and note all compliance issues. Produce a baseline code quality assessment using appropriate metrics.

## 2. Implement Modular Architecture with Proper Separation of Concerns [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Restructure the AuthViewModel to follow MVVM best practices with clear separation of concerns and improved modularity.
### Details:
Break down the AuthViewModel into smaller, focused components following single responsibility principle. Extract authentication logic into dedicated service classes. Create protocol-based interfaces for dependencies to improve testability. Implement proper dependency injection. Refactor large methods into smaller, reusable functions with clear purposes. Use extensions to organize code by functionality. Ensure compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 regarding modularity and separation of concerns.

## 3. Implement Robust Error Handling and State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.2
### Description: Enhance error handling throughout the AuthViewModel using Swift best practices and implement proper state management.
### Details:
Create custom error types using enums with associated values to represent different authentication failure scenarios. Implement Result type for all asynchronous operations. Add proper error propagation through the view model to the UI layer. Implement a state management system using Swift's property observers or a custom Dynamic<T> binding class to handle loading, success, and error states. Ensure all error paths are handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback mechanisms.

## 4. Add Comprehensive Documentation and Code Comments [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.3
### Description: Document all public methods, properties, and complex logic in the refactored AuthViewModel to meet documentation standards.
### Details:
Add documentation comments to all public methods and properties following Swift documentation standards. Include parameter descriptions, return value explanations, and usage examples where appropriate. Document the rationale behind design decisions and architectural choices. Add inline comments for complex logic sections. Create a class-level documentation block explaining the overall purpose and usage of the AuthViewModel. Ensure full compliance with .cursorrules §8.2 documentation standards.

## 5. Perform Final Quality Review and Create Summary Document [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.4
### Description: Conduct a comprehensive review of the refactored code and create a detailed summary document of all changes and improvements.
### Details:
Run code quality analysis tools to verify the refactored code achieves over 90% code quality rating. Check for any remaining code smells or potential improvements. Verify full compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2. Create a detailed summary document outlining all changes made during the refactoring process, including: architectural improvements, modularity enhancements, error handling strategies implemented, documentation additions, and compliance verification. Include before/after metrics and explain the rationale behind major design decisions.
