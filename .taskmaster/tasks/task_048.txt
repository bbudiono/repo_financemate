# Task ID: 48
# Title: Implement Comprehensive UI and Unit Tests for Dashboard Page (Task #47)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 47
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and update exhaustive UI and unit tests for the new Dashboard page in Sandbox, ensuring all user flows, navigation, and UI/UX elements comply with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. This task must follow TDD principles and be logged as a P0 test task linked to Task #47.
# Details:
Begin by reviewing the Dashboard page implementation (Task #47) and the Corporate Style Guide, including .cursorrules, to identify all required UI/UX standards and user flows. Design test cases that cover every interactive element, navigation path, and edge case, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness. Implement unit tests for all Dashboard components, mocking dependencies as needed, and create end-to-end UI tests simulating real user interactions. Use TDD: write failing tests before implementing or refactoring code, then iterate until all tests pass. Document test coverage and rationale, and ensure traceability to Task #47. Coordinate with design and QA to validate compliance with style and UX guidelines.

# Test Strategy:
Verify completion by ensuring 100% test coverage for Dashboard components and user flows, with all tests passing in CI. Review test cases for alignment with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules, and confirm that all navigation, error states, and edge cases are exercised. Conduct peer review of test code and documentation. Validate that the Dashboard meets UI/UX standards through automated and manual testing, and confirm traceability to Task #47 in the tracking system.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review Dashboard Implementation and Corporate Style Guide [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the Dashboard page implementation (Task #47) alongside the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules to identify all UI/UX standards, required user flows, and interactive elements.
### Details:
Gather all relevant documentation and source code for the Dashboard page. Cross-reference each UI component, navigation path, and interactive element with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Document all required standards, flows, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

## 2. Design Exhaustive Test Cases Covering UI, UX, and User Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 48.1
### Description: Develop detailed test cases for every interactive element, navigation path, and edge case, ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and compliance with style guidelines.
### Details:
Write test cases for each identified requirement, including positive and negative scenarios, accessibility checks, and responsive design validation. Ensure all user flows, error states, and edge cases are addressed. Map each test case to specific style guide rules and .cursorrules for traceability.

## 3. Implement Unit Tests for Dashboard Components Using TDD [pending]
### Dependencies: 48.2
### Description: Write unit tests for all Dashboard components, mocking dependencies as needed, following TDD principles: write failing tests first, then implement or refactor code until tests pass.
### Details:
For each component, start by writing unit tests that cover all logic branches, props, and state changes. Use mocking frameworks to isolate dependencies. Only implement or refactor component code after tests are written, ensuring tests drive development. Maintain clear linkage to test cases and requirements.

## 4. Develop End-to-End UI Tests Simulating Real User Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 48.3
### Description: Create automated end-to-end UI tests that simulate real user interactions, covering navigation, data entry, error handling, and accessibility across devices and browsers.
### Details:
Use a UI testing framework to script user journeys through the Dashboard, including navigation, form submissions, and edge cases. Validate UI responsiveness, accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA roles), and compliance with the Corporate Style Guide. Test across multiple browsers and device sizes.

## 5. Document Test Coverage, Rationale, and Traceability [pending]
### Dependencies: 48.4
### Description: Compile documentation detailing test coverage, rationale for test cases, and traceability to Task #47 and style guide requirements. Coordinate with design and QA for validation.
### Details:
Summarize which requirements, user flows, and style rules are covered by each test. Explain the rationale for test design decisions. Link all tests to Task #47 and relevant style guide sections. Share documentation with design and QA teams for review and validation of compliance.
