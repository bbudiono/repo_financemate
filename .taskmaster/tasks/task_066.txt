# Task ID: 66
# Title: Refactor AuthenticationService.swift
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: High
# Description: Refactor _macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/Sources/Services/AuthenticationService.swift to improve its code quality score to at least 90% as per .cursorrules. Focus on clarity, testability, error handling, and adherence to best practices for authentication services.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and Document Current AuthenticationService.swift [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing AuthenticationService.swift file to identify code quality issues, unclear logic, insufficient error handling, and areas lacking testability. Document all findings and improvement opportunities.
### Details:
Read through the entire file, noting code smells, violations of .cursorrules, and any non-standard authentication practices. Create a checklist of issues to address in the refactor.

## 2. Refactor for Clarity and Modularity [pending]
### Dependencies: 66.1
### Description: Restructure the code to improve readability, maintainability, and modularity. Break down large functions, clarify variable and method names, and organize code into logical sections.
### Details:
Apply Swift best practices for naming, code organization, and modularization. Ensure each function has a single responsibility and that logic is easy to follow.

## 3. Enhance Error Handling and Security [pending]
### Dependencies: 66.2
### Description: Implement robust error handling and strengthen security measures in line with authentication best practices. Ensure all authentication flows handle failures gracefully and securely.
### Details:
Add comprehensive error handling using Swift's error types. Validate all user inputs, securely handle credentials, and use secure storage and transmission methods. Follow guidelines for secure password management and session handling[2][4].

## 4. Improve Testability and Add Unit Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 66.3
### Description: Refactor code to support dependency injection and mocking, making the service easily testable. Add or update unit tests to cover all authentication logic and error cases.
### Details:
Abstract dependencies (e.g., network, storage) to protocols. Use mocks in tests to simulate authentication flows. Ensure high code coverage, especially for error and edge cases.

## 5. Ensure Compliance with .cursorrules and Final Code Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 66.4
### Description: Review the refactored AuthenticationService.swift to ensure it meets or exceeds a 90% code quality score as per .cursorrules. Conduct a final code review for best practices, clarity, and maintainability.
### Details:
Use automated tools to check compliance with .cursorrules. Address any remaining issues. Perform a peer review to validate adherence to authentication service best practices and project standards.
