# Task ID: 43
# Title: Implement Modular, Editable Profile Page with Avatar and SSO Integration (P0 Feature)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a professional, modular, and reusable Profile page in Sandbox that supports editable user data, avatar upload, and SSO-linked fields, fully compliant with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules.
# Details:
Design and implement a Profile page component that is modular and reusable across Sandbox, ensuring all user data fields (name, nickname, email, etc.) are editable except for SSO-linked fields, which should be clearly indicated as read-only. Integrate a robust avatar upload feature with image validation and preview. Ensure the UI strictly adheres to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules, referencing example code in docs/ExampleCode/XcodeFiles/Example macOS Application for best practices. The component must support responsive layouts, intuitive navigation, and accessibility standards. All forms should use clear labels, pre-populated fields where appropriate, and provide immediate feedback on validation errors. Structure the codebase for easy extension and maintenance, and document all public interfaces. Prioritize performance optimization and maintain design consistency throughout the page.

# Test Strategy:
Adopt a strict TDD approach: write comprehensive unit and UI tests before implementation, covering all editable fields, avatar upload (including error states), and SSO-linked field restrictions. Verify compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules through automated style linting and manual review. Test responsiveness across devices and browsers, and ensure accessibility via automated tools and manual checks. Validate that all user flows (edit, save, cancel, upload avatar, SSO field display) function as intended, and that the component is reusable in other contexts. Log this as a P0 (high-priority) feature task.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Profile Component Structure with Style Guide Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundational component architecture for the Profile page following modular design principles and Corporate Style Guide compliance
### Details:
Develop the base Profile component with a modular structure that separates concerns into presentational and container components. Reference the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules to implement the visual framework. Create reusable UI elements that can be composed together following component composition patterns. Ensure responsive layouts are implemented with appropriate breakpoints. Reference the example code in docs/ExampleCode/XcodeFiles/Example macOS Application for structural guidance.

## 2. Implement Editable User Data Fields with Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.1
### Description: Build form components for user data that support editing, validation, and clear indication of field status
### Details:
Create form components for each editable user field (name, nickname, email, etc.) with appropriate input validation. Implement clear visual indicators for field states (editable, read-only, error, success). Design the validation system to provide immediate feedback on errors. Pre-populate fields with existing user data where available. Ensure all form elements have proper labels and meet accessibility standards. Use component composition to maintain modularity while creating a cohesive form experience.

## 3. Develop SSO Integration with Read-Only Field Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.2
### Description: Integrate SSO authentication and implement special handling for SSO-linked fields
### Details:
Connect to the SSO authentication system to retrieve user identity information. Implement logic to identify and mark SSO-linked fields as read-only with clear visual indicators. Create appropriate UI messaging to explain why certain fields cannot be edited. Ensure the SSO integration gracefully handles authentication failures and provides appropriate user feedback. Maintain the modular structure by isolating SSO-specific logic in dedicated components.

## 4. Create Avatar Upload Component with Image Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.1
### Description: Build a robust avatar upload feature with preview, validation, and image processing capabilities
### Details:
Develop a modular avatar upload component that supports image selection, preview, and validation. Implement image validation for format, size, and dimensions. Create a cropping/resizing interface for user-friendly image adjustment. Handle image processing on the client-side before upload to optimize performance. Ensure the component provides clear feedback during the upload process. Follow the Corporate Style Guide for visual elements and interactions. Make the component reusable for potential use in other parts of the application.

## 5. Integrate Components and Optimize Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.2, 43.3, 43.4
### Description: Assemble all modular components into the complete Profile page and optimize for performance and maintainability
### Details:
Compose all previously developed components into the final Profile page. Implement state management to coordinate between components while maintaining modularity. Optimize rendering performance through code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization where appropriate. Ensure consistent error handling and user feedback throughout the page. Document all public interfaces and component APIs for future maintenance. Perform final accessibility checks and responsive layout testing. Create comprehensive documentation for the component library.
