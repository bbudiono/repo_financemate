# Task ID: 6
# Title: Simple Calendar View and Event Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a basic calendar view for visualizing and managing case-related events.
# Details:
Use SwiftUI to build a calendar component. Display events (court dates, deadlines, meetings). Support event creation, editing, and deletion. Connect to CoreData Event model.

# Test Strategy:
Test event creation, editing, deletion, and calendar display. Verify event-case relationships.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement SwiftUI Calendar View [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a reusable SwiftUI calendar component that displays a monthly view and allows date selection.
### Details:
Use SwiftUI to build a calendar grid, showing days of the current month. Ensure the component is modular for reuse. Reference best practices for calendar UI in SwiftUI, such as using custom views or integrating with FSCalendar via UIViewRepresentable if needed.

## 2. Integrate CoreData Event Model with Calendar [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Connect the calendar view to the CoreData Event model to fetch and display events for each date.
### Details:
Fetch events from CoreData and map them to their respective dates. Display event indicators (such as dots or highlights) on days with events. Ensure efficient data fetching and updates when the calendar month changes.

## 3. Implement Event List and Detail Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Show a list of events for the selected date and provide a detail view for each event.
### Details:
When a user selects a date, display a list of events for that day below or beside the calendar. Allow tapping on an event to view its details in a modal or navigation view.

## 4. Enable Event Creation, Editing, and Deletion [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Allow users to create new events, edit existing ones, and delete events directly from the calendar interface.
### Details:
Provide UI controls (such as buttons or context menus) for adding, editing, and deleting events. Use forms for event input and ensure changes are persisted to CoreData and reflected in the calendar view.

## 5. Polish UI and Ensure Accessibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Refine the calendar and event management UI for usability and accessibility, ensuring a smooth user experience.
### Details:
Improve visual design, add accessibility labels, and ensure the interface is navigable via VoiceOver. Test responsiveness and usability on different device sizes.
