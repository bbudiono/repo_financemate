# Task ID: 44
# Title: Implement Comprehensive UI and Unit Tests for Profile Page (Task #43)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 43
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and update thorough UI and unit tests for the new Profile page in Sandbox, ensuring all editable fields, avatar upload, SSO integration, and UI/UX compliance are fully covered.
# Details:
Create automated UI tests (using tools such as Cypress or Selenium) to validate all editable fields, avatar upload functionality, and SSO integration workflows on the Profile page. Ensure tests verify field validation, error handling, and correct data persistence. Implement unit tests for all Profile page components, focusing on input handling, state management, and integration points. All tests must explicitly check for compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules, including layout, color schemes, spacing, and interactive behaviors. Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices: write or update tests before implementing or refactoring features. Document all test cases and ensure traceability to requirements. Log this as a P0 test task and link it directly to Task #43 for dependency tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Verify completion by running the full suite of UI and unit tests, ensuring 100% coverage of editable fields, avatar upload, and SSO integration. Manually review UI test screenshots or video captures to confirm adherence to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Validate that all tests pass in CI/CD pipelines and that any UI/UX deviations are flagged and resolved. Confirm that tests are written or updated before feature implementation (TDD), and that all acceptance criteria from Task #43 are traceable to corresponding test cases.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up test environment and framework configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the testing environment for both UI and unit tests, including necessary tools, dependencies, and integration with the CI/CD pipeline.
### Details:
Install and configure Cypress for UI testing and Jest for unit testing. Set up test fixtures, mocks, and stubs for Profile page components. Create baseline configuration files that enforce Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules compliance checks. Configure test reporting and coverage metrics to track test effectiveness.

## 2. Implement unit tests for Profile page components [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive unit tests for all Profile page components, focusing on input validation, state management, and component interactions.
### Details:
Create unit tests for each Profile page component following TDD principles. Test form validation logic for all editable fields including required fields, format validation, and error states. Implement tests for state management across the Profile page, including loading states and user feedback. Mock API endpoints and test integration points with backend services. Ensure all tests verify compliance with style guidelines.

## 3. Develop UI tests for Profile page editing functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.1
### Description: Create automated UI tests that validate all editable fields, form submissions, and error handling on the Profile page.
### Details:
Implement end-to-end tests using Cypress that simulate user interactions with all editable fields. Create test scenarios for successful form submission, validation errors, and cancellation flows. Test field-specific behaviors such as character limits, input masks, and auto-formatting. Verify that error messages are displayed correctly and that successful updates persist. Include visual regression tests to ensure UI compliance with the Corporate Style Guide.

## 4. Implement tests for avatar upload functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.1, 44.3
### Description: Develop specialized tests for the avatar upload feature, including file selection, image processing, and error handling.
### Details:
Create UI tests that simulate the complete avatar upload process, including file selection dialog interaction. Test various file types (valid and invalid), file sizes, and image dimensions to verify proper validation. Implement tests for image cropping/resizing functionality if applicable. Verify that uploaded avatars are correctly displayed and persisted. Test error scenarios such as upload failures and server rejections.

## 5. Develop tests for SSO integration and authentication flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.1, 44.2
### Description: Create comprehensive tests for Single Sign-On integration, authentication workflows, and session management on the Profile page.
### Details:
Implement tests that verify SSO authentication flows, including login, logout, and session management. Test scenarios where users switch between authentication methods. Verify that profile data is correctly associated with authenticated users. Test permission-based access controls for profile editing. Ensure proper error handling for authentication failures and expired sessions. Document all test cases with traceability to SSO integration requirements.
