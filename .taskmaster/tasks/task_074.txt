# Task ID: 74
# Title: Add Unit Test for AuthenticationError Equality in AuthViewModel
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a unit test in _macOS/FinanceMate/Tests/ to verify correct equality comparisons between AuthenticationError instances within AuthViewModel, covering all error cases and associated values.
# Details:
Implement a new unit test file (e.g., AuthViewModelAuthenticationErrorTests.swift) in the _macOS/FinanceMate/Tests/ directory. The test should instantiate various AuthenticationError cases, including those with associated values, and assert their equality and inequality as appropriate. Ensure the test covers all defined error cases, especially those that previously caused regressions (such as PMBE-COMPILER-001). Use descriptive test method names and include comments explaining the intent of each scenario. If AuthenticationError conforms to Equatable, verify that both positive (equal) and negative (not equal) comparisons behave as expected. If necessary, mock or stub dependencies to isolate the error comparison logic within AuthViewModel.

# Test Strategy:
Run the new unit test suite and confirm that all assertions regarding AuthenticationError equality and inequality pass. Deliberately introduce a failing case (e.g., compare two different error cases) to ensure the test fails as expected, then revert. Review test coverage to confirm all error cases and associated values are exercised. Validate that the test prevents regressions by running it after any future changes to AuthenticationError or AuthViewModel.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review AuthenticationError Enum and Equatable Conformance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the AuthenticationError enum in the codebase to identify all cases, including those with associated values, and verify or implement Equatable conformance if necessary.
### Details:
Locate the AuthenticationError definition and list all its cases. Ensure that it conforms to Equatable, either via automatic synthesis or a custom implementation if associated values require it. Document any special considerations for equality, especially for cases with complex associated values.

## 2. Set Up Unit Test File for AuthenticationError Equality [pending]
### Dependencies: 74.1
### Description: Create a new unit test file named AuthViewModelAuthenticationErrorTests.swift in the _macOS/FinanceMate/Tests/ directory, following project conventions.
### Details:
Add the new test file to the appropriate test target. Import necessary modules and set up the test class structure, ensuring it is discoverable by the test runner.

## 3. Implement Equality and Inequality Test Cases for All AuthenticationError Variants [pending]
### Dependencies: 74.2
### Description: Write unit tests that instantiate each AuthenticationError case, including those with associated values, and assert both equality and inequality using XCTAssertEqual and XCTAssertNotEqual.
### Details:
For each error case, create pairs of equal and non-equal instances. Use descriptive test method names and comments to clarify the intent of each scenario. Pay special attention to cases that previously caused regressions.

## 4. Isolate Error Comparison Logic from AuthViewModel Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 74.3
### Description: Mock or stub any dependencies required by AuthViewModel to ensure that the unit tests focus solely on AuthenticationError equality logic.
### Details:
If AuthViewModel initialization or error production requires external dependencies, use mocks or stubs to provide minimal implementations. Ensure that the tests do not fail due to unrelated logic.

## 5. Document Test Scenarios and Ensure Comprehensive Coverage [pending]
### Dependencies: 74.4
### Description: Add comments to each test method explaining the scenario being tested, and review the test suite to confirm that all AuthenticationError cases and edge cases are covered.
### Details:
Review the AuthenticationError definition and cross-check with the implemented tests. Add comments to clarify intent and rationale, especially for complex or previously problematic cases. Refactor or add tests as needed to ensure no case is missed.
