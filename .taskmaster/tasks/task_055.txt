# Task ID: 55
# Title: Refactor User.swift for Code Quality, Modularity, and Maintainability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the User.swift file in the Sandbox project to enhance code quality, modularity, and maintainability, targeting over 90% code and problem rating. Expand or add tests, update the comment block, and ensure full alignment with the Corporate Style Guide.
# Details:
Begin by analyzing User.swift for code smells, large or complex methods, and opportunities to modularize logic into smaller, reusable components. Apply Swift best practices, such as leveraging protocol-oriented programming, clear naming conventions, and concise, expressive syntax. Use Xcode's refactoring tools (e.g., Rename, Extract Method) to safely restructure code while preserving functionality. Update or add comprehensive documentation, including an updated comment block at the top of the file that describes its purpose, usage, and key classes or methods. Ensure all code and comments strictly adhere to the Corporate Style Guide. Expand or create unit tests to cover all logic paths, edge cases, and error handling, aiming for over 90% code coverage. Commit changes incrementally with clear messages to maintain a transparent refactoring history. Consider updating linter configurations if recurring issues are found, to prevent regressions in code quality.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all existing and new unit tests pass, and that code coverage for User.swift exceeds 90%. Use static analysis tools (e.g., SwiftLint, SwiftFormat) to confirm adherence to style and linting rules. Manually review the updated comment block and documentation for completeness and alignment with the Corporate Style Guide. Perform code reviews to ensure improved modularity, maintainability, and readability. Validate that no regressions or breaking changes have been introduced by running the full test suite and performing targeted manual testing of affected features.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze User.swift for Code Smells and Refactoring Opportunities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the User.swift file to identify code smells, large or complex methods, and areas where logic can be modularized. Document specific issues and opportunities for improvement, referencing the Corporate Style Guide.
### Details:
Use static analysis tools and manual inspection to find duplicated code, long methods, unclear naming, and violations of style guidelines. Create a checklist of items to address in the refactor.

## 2. Refactor Code for Modularity and Maintainability [pending]
### Dependencies: 55.1
### Description: Refactor the identified areas in User.swift to improve modularity, readability, and maintainability, applying Swift best practices and protocol-oriented programming where appropriate.
### Details:
Break down large methods into smaller, reusable functions or extensions. Apply clear naming conventions and concise syntax. Use Xcode's refactoring tools (e.g., Rename, Extract Method) to safely restructure code while preserving functionality.

## 3. Update and Expand Documentation and Comment Block [pending]
### Dependencies: 55.2
### Description: Revise and expand the comment block at the top of User.swift to clearly describe its purpose, usage, and key classes or methods. Ensure all code comments and documentation align with the Corporate Style Guide.
### Details:
Update the file-level comment block and add or revise inline documentation for complex logic. Reference the Corporate Style Guide for formatting and content requirements.

## 4. Expand and Enhance Unit Test Coverage [pending]
### Dependencies: 55.2
### Description: Add or update unit tests to cover all logic paths, edge cases, and error handling in User.swift, targeting over 90% code coverage.
### Details:
Identify untested code paths and write new tests as needed. Use XCTest or the project's preferred testing framework. Ensure tests are clear, isolated, and maintainable.

## 5. Align with Corporate Style Guide and Update Linter Configurations [pending]
### Dependencies: 55.3, 55.4
### Description: Review the refactored User.swift and update linter configurations (e.g., SwiftLint) if recurring style issues are found. Ensure all code and comments strictly adhere to the Corporate Style Guide.
### Details:
Run linters and address any violations. If new patterns or recurring issues are identified, update linter rules to enforce them. Perform a final review for style and consistency.
