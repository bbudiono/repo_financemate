# Task ID: 90
# Title: Implement Google SSO with Editable Profile Page and OAuth Popup for MVP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop Google Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication using OAuth popup, and create a detailed, editable user profile page that integrates real-world Google accounts for the MVP.
# Details:
Set up Google OAuth 2.0 credentials in the Google Cloud Console, ensuring the correct redirect URIs and scopes for profile and email access. Integrate Google SSO into the application using an OAuth popup flow, handling authentication, token exchange, and error states. Upon successful sign-in, fetch and display user profile data (name, email, avatar) on a dedicated profile page. Implement profile editing functionality, allowing users to update editable fields (excluding immutable Google account data). Ensure the profile page is responsive, secure, and updates in real time. Store user data securely and handle session management. Prioritize clear error handling, loading states, and accessibility throughout the flow. Document setup steps for local and production environments.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that users can sign in with real Google accounts via OAuth popup and are redirected appropriately. Confirm that user profile data is fetched and displayed accurately after authentication. Test profile editing functionality, ensuring changes persist and immutable fields remain uneditable. Validate error handling for failed logins, token issues, and network errors. Check session persistence and logout functionality. Perform cross-browser and device testing for the OAuth popup and profile page. Review accessibility and responsiveness. Confirm that setup documentation enables successful configuration in both local and production environments.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console with appropriate scopes and redirect URIs for the application
### Details:
Create a new project in Google Cloud Console, navigate to API & Services > Credentials, and create OAuth client ID credentials. Configure the Web application type, add authorized redirect URIs that match your application's callback endpoint, and request scopes for profile and email access. Store the obtained Client ID and Client Secret securely for use in the application.

## 2. Implement OAuth Popup Authentication Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 90.1
### Description: Develop the frontend and backend components for Google SSO authentication using a popup window
### Details:
Create a login button that triggers a popup window directed to Google's authorization endpoint with the client ID and required scopes. Implement the redirect URI endpoint to receive the authorization code. Add server-side logic to exchange the authorization code for access and ID tokens via a secure server-to-server request to Google's token endpoint. Handle all potential error states and edge cases in the authentication flow.

## 3. Create User Data Storage and Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 90.2
### Description: Develop backend services to securely store user profile data and manage authentication sessions
### Details:
Design and implement a database schema to store user profile information retrieved from Google (name, email, avatar) along with additional editable fields. Create session management logic using secure HTTP-only cookies or JWT tokens. Implement middleware to verify authentication status on protected routes. Ensure proper data encryption and security practices for storing sensitive user information.

## 4. Build Responsive User Profile Page [pending]
### Dependencies: 90.3
### Description: Develop a detailed user profile page that displays Google account information and allows editing of customizable fields
### Details:
Create a responsive profile page that displays user information retrieved from Google (name, email, avatar) as read-only fields. Implement editable fields for additional user information. Add form validation for editable fields and real-time feedback. Ensure the page is accessible and works across different devices and screen sizes. Implement loading states for asynchronous operations.

## 5. Document Setup and Create Environment Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 90.1, 90.2, 90.3, 90.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for local and production setup of the Google SSO integration
### Details:
Document the complete setup process including Google Cloud Console configuration steps, required environment variables, and application settings. Create separate configuration instructions for development and production environments. Include troubleshooting guides for common issues. Implement environment-specific configuration handling in the application code to support different redirect URIs and security settings based on the deployment environment.
