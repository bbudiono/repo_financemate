# Task ID: 91
# Title: Design and Implement MVP Product Landing Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a high-conversion Product Landing/Get Started/Features page for the MVP, highlighting core value propositions and guiding users to sign up or get started.
# Details:
Design and develop a responsive landing page that clearly communicates the product's unique value proposition, features, and benefits. The page should include a compelling headline, concise benefit-driven copy, a prominent call-to-action (CTA) such as 'Get Started' or 'Sign Up', and supporting visuals (e.g., product screenshots or hero images). Remove unnecessary navigation and exit links to focus user attention on conversion. Incorporate trust indicators (e.g., testimonials, security badges) and ensure the visual hierarchy guides users from headline to CTA. Collaborate with stakeholders to finalize copy and imagery. Prioritize clarity, relevance, and fast load times for MVP. Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness throughout.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the landing page displays correctly on all major browsers and devices. Confirm the headline, feature list, visuals, and CTA are present and visually prominent. Test that the CTA leads to the correct sign-up or onboarding flow. Check that navigation and exit links are minimized or removed as appropriate. Validate accessibility (contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation). Solicit stakeholder feedback on clarity and persuasiveness of messaging. Use analytics or test accounts to ensure conversion tracking is functional.
