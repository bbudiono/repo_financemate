# Task ID: 65
# Title: Investigate and Fix Unused Result Warning for 'togglePasswordVisibility' in SignInView.swift
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze and resolve the 'result of call to 'togglePasswordVisibility' is unused' warning at line 135 in SignInView.swift by ensuring the function's return value is handled appropriately or modifying the function signature if no value should be returned.
# Details:
Review the implementation of 'togglePasswordVisibility' to determine if its return value is necessary for the calling context. If the return value is meaningful, update the call at line 135 to use or store the result as appropriate. If the function is not intended to return a value, refactor it to return Void and update its signature accordingly. Consider using the @discardableResult attribute if the result is optional for callers. Ensure that any changes preserve existing functionality and adhere to Swift best practices regarding unused results and compiler warnings.

# Test Strategy:
Rebuild the project and verify that the warning no longer appears at line 135 in SignInView.swift. Confirm that the password visibility toggle feature continues to work as expected through manual UI testing. If the function was modified to return Void, ensure no unintended side effects occur. If the result is now handled, add or update unit tests to verify correct usage of the return value and that no regressions are introduced.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Locate and Review 'togglePasswordVisibility' Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify the definition of the 'togglePasswordVisibility' function and analyze its current return type and usage within SignInView.swift.
### Details:
Search for the 'togglePasswordVisibility' function in the codebase. Examine its implementation to determine whether it returns a value and if that value is intended to be used by callers.

## 2. Assess Necessity of Return Value in Calling Context [pending]
### Dependencies: 65.1
### Description: Evaluate whether the return value of 'togglePasswordVisibility' is meaningful or required at the call site (line 135 in SignInView.swift).
### Details:
Review the logic at line 135 and surrounding code to determine if the result of 'togglePasswordVisibility' should be used, stored, or can be safely ignored.

## 3. Refactor Function Signature or Handle Return Value Appropriately [pending]
### Dependencies: 65.2
### Description: Based on the assessment, either update the function to return Void if the result is not needed, or modify the call at line 135 to use or store the result if it is meaningful.
### Details:
If the return value is unnecessary, change the function's return type to Void and update all relevant calls. If the value is needed, ensure it is handled at the call site (e.g., assign to a variable or use in logic).

## 4. Consider Use of @discardableResult Attribute if Appropriate [pending]
### Dependencies: 65.3
### Description: If the function's return value is optional for callers, annotate the function with @discardableResult to suppress the unused result warning where intentional.
### Details:
Add the @discardableResult attribute to the function if some callers may intentionally ignore the result, following Swift best practices[5][4].

## 5. Test and Validate Changes for Correctness and Warning Resolution [pending]
### Dependencies: 65.4
### Description: Run the project and verify that the 'unused result' warning is resolved, and that all related functionality works as intended.
### Details:
Build and test the application, focusing on the SignInView and any features related to password visibility toggling. Confirm that no new warnings or errors are introduced.
