# Task ID: 46
# Title: Implement Comprehensive UI and Unit Tests for Settings Page (P0, TDD, Linked to Task #45)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 45
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and update thorough UI and unit tests for the new Settings page, ensuring full coverage of user preferences, account management, SSO settings, and strict adherence to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. This task must follow TDD principles and be logged as a P0 test task linked to Task #45.
# Details:
Begin by reviewing the implementation details and requirements from Task #45 to identify all user preferences, account management, and SSO features present on the Settings page. Design and implement unit tests for all business logic, state management, and data validation related to these features. Develop comprehensive UI tests to verify that all interactive elements, workflows, and error states function as intended. Ensure that all visual and interactive components strictly comply with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules, including layout, color, typography, spacing, and accessibility. Use TDD: write failing tests before implementing or updating code, then refactor as needed to achieve passing tests. Document all test cases and ensure traceability to requirements. Coordinate with design and QA to validate UI/UX compliance. Log this as a P0 test task and explicitly link it to Task #45 in the tracking system.

# Test Strategy:
Verify completion by ensuring 100% unit and UI test coverage for all new and updated features on the Settings page, including user preferences, account management, and SSO settings. Run automated test suites to confirm all tests pass. Manually review UI test results and perform visual regression testing to confirm compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Cross-check test cases against requirements and acceptance criteria from Task #45. Confirm that all tests were written before or alongside feature code (TDD). Ensure the task is logged as P0 and properly linked to Task #45 in the project management system.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Test Plan and Review Task #45 Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review implementation details from Task #45 and create a comprehensive test plan that identifies all testable components of the Settings page
### Details:
Analyze Task #45 documentation to identify all user preferences, account management, and SSO features. Create a test matrix mapping each feature to required test cases. Document acceptance criteria for each component based on Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Identify critical user workflows that need testing. Establish traceability between requirements and planned test cases.

## 2. Implement Unit Tests for Settings Page Business Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.1
### Description: Following TDD principles, write unit tests for all business logic, state management, and data validation in the Settings page
### Details:
Write failing unit tests for user preference storage/retrieval, account management operations, SSO authentication flows, and data validation logic. Focus on edge cases, error handling, and state transitions. Ensure tests verify correct application of business rules. Include tests for API interactions and service layer components. Document each test's purpose and expected outcomes.

## 3. Develop UI Component Tests for Settings Page Elements [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.1
### Description: Create component-level UI tests for all individual UI elements on the Settings page following TDD methodology
### Details:
Write failing tests for each UI component (form fields, toggles, dropdowns, buttons) to verify proper rendering, state changes, and event handling. Test accessibility compliance including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and ARIA attributes. Verify components follow Corporate Style Guide for typography, colors, spacing, and layout. Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes.

## 4. Implement End-to-End UI Tests for Settings Page Workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.2, 46.3
### Description: Develop comprehensive end-to-end tests for complete user workflows on the Settings page
### Details:
Create E2E tests for critical user journeys: updating account information, changing preferences, configuring SSO settings, and handling error states. Test form submission flows including validation and error messaging. Verify data persistence across page refreshes. Test navigation between different sections of the Settings page. Include tests for loading states and performance metrics.

## 5. Finalize Test Documentation and Link to Task #45 [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.4
### Description: Document all test cases, verify complete test coverage, and ensure proper linking to Task #45 in the tracking system
### Details:
Create comprehensive test documentation including test objectives, prerequisites, steps, and expected results. Verify traceability between requirements and implemented tests. Generate test coverage reports for both unit and UI tests. Update task metadata to explicitly link this P0 test task to Task #45 in the tracking system. Prepare test summary report highlighting test results, coverage metrics, and any identified issues.
