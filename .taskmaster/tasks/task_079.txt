# Task ID: 79
# Title: Parse and Add Product Feature Inbox Items as Individual Tasks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Parse all items from the Product Feature Inbox and create corresponding, actionable tasks for each feature, ensuring clarity and alignment with project requirements.
# Details:
Review the Product Feature Inbox and extract each listed feature as a discrete, well-defined task. For each feature, ensure the task includes a clear title, concise description, relevant acceptance criteria, and any dependencies or references (such as design guidelines, .env requirements, or documentation paths). Organize tasks by functional area (e.g., UX/UI, SSO, Core Data, Navigation, User Profile) and ensure each task is actionable and unambiguous. Cross-reference the Corporate Style Guide and any provided example code or documentation to ensure tasks are aligned with technical and design standards. Assign initial priorities and link related tasks where dependencies exist. Document the parsing process and provide a summary of all newly created tasks for review.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that every item from the Product Feature Inbox has been parsed and represented as a distinct, actionable task. Review each task for clarity, completeness, and alignment with the original feature description. Confirm that tasks include necessary references, acceptance criteria, and are organized logically. Conduct a peer review to ensure no features were omitted or misinterpreted, and validate that the summary of created tasks matches the original inbox content.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extract and Categorize Product Feature Inbox Items [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the Product Feature Inbox and extract all feature items, organizing them by functional area (UX/UI, SSO, Core Data, Navigation, User Profile).
### Details:
Create a structured inventory of all inbox items with their original descriptions. For each item, identify and document the functional category it belongs to. Maintain the original context and requirements while organizing them into a standardized format that can be used for task creation. Document any unclear items that need further clarification.

## 2. Define Task Template and Structure for Feature Items [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a standardized task template that ensures consistency across all feature tasks, including fields for title, description, acceptance criteria, and dependencies.
### Details:
Review the Corporate Style Guide to ensure task template aligns with company standards. Include sections for title (clear and concise), description (detailed explanation), acceptance criteria (measurable outcomes), dependencies (related tasks or requirements), and references (design guidelines, documentation paths, etc.). Create example tasks to validate the template's effectiveness.

## 3. Transform Feature Items into Structured Tasks [pending]
### Dependencies: 79.1, 79.2
### Description: Convert each categorized feature item into a well-defined task using the standardized template, ensuring clarity and actionability.
### Details:
For each feature item, create a corresponding task with a clear title that describes the feature purpose. Write a concise but comprehensive description that explains what needs to be implemented. Define specific acceptance criteria that will determine when the task is complete. Include any technical requirements, design specifications, or documentation references. Cross-reference with the Corporate Style Guide to ensure alignment with technical and design standards.

## 4. Establish Task Dependencies and Priorities [pending]
### Dependencies: 79.3
### Description: Analyze all created tasks to identify and document dependencies between them, and assign initial priorities based on project requirements.
### Details:
Review all tasks to identify logical dependencies (tasks that must be completed before others can begin). Create a dependency map showing relationships between tasks. Assign initial priorities to each task based on business value, technical dependencies, and implementation complexity. Ensure that high-priority items with no dependencies are flagged for immediate action. Document the rationale for priority assignments to facilitate stakeholder discussions.

## 5. Generate Task Summary Report and Reset Status [pending]
### Dependencies: 79.3, 79.4
### Description: Create a comprehensive summary report of all newly created tasks and set their status to 'pending' as required.
### Details:
Compile a summary report that includes: total number of tasks created, breakdown by functional area, priority distribution, and dependency chains. Include any items that required special handling or additional clarification. Ensure all tasks are set to 'pending' status regardless of their current state, as specified in the requirements. Prepare the report in a format suitable for stakeholder review and project planning sessions.
