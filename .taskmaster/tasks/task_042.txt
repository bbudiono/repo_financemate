# Task ID: 42
# Title: Implement Comprehensive UI and Unit Tests for SSO Modal (Task #41)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 41
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and update thorough UI and unit tests for the new SSO modal in Sandbox, covering all user flows (Apple/Google SSO), error states, and UI/UX compliance with the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules. Ensure tests are written using TDD and log this as a P0 test task linked to Task #41.
# Details:
Begin by reviewing the implementation of the SSO modal from Task #41, including all supported user flows (Apple and Google SSO), error handling, and loading states. Design and implement unit tests for all modal logic, including authentication triggers, error propagation, and state transitions. Develop UI tests that simulate user interactions for both Apple and Google SSO, covering successful logins, cancellations, and all error scenarios (e.g., network failures, invalid credentials). Validate that the modal's appearance, transitions, and interactive elements strictly adhere to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules, referencing the provided example code as needed. Use a TDD approach: write failing tests first, then implement or update code to pass them. Ensure all tests are maintainable, well-documented, and integrated into the CI pipeline. Clearly link this task to Task #41 and mark it as P0 priority.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all user flows (Apple and Google SSO) are covered by automated UI and unit tests, including edge cases and error states. Confirm that tests fail when the modal deviates from the Corporate Style Guide or .cursorrules, and pass when compliant. Run tests in the CI environment to ensure reliability and repeatability. Manually review test coverage reports to confirm 100% coverage of modal logic and UI states. Validate that all acceptance criteria from Task #41 are exercised by the tests. Ensure that the task is logged as P0 and properly linked to Task #41 in the project tracking system.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review SSO Modal Implementation and Define Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the SSO modal implementation from Task #41, including Apple and Google SSO flows, error handling, and loading states. Identify all user flows, edge cases, and UI/UX requirements based on the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules.
### Details:
Carefully review the codebase and documentation for the SSO modal. List all authentication triggers, state transitions, error states, and UI/UX compliance points. Document comprehensive test scenarios covering successful logins, cancellations, error cases (e.g., network failures, invalid credentials), and visual/interactive requirements.

## 2. Design and Implement Unit Tests for SSO Modal Logic Using TDD [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.1
### Description: Write unit tests for all modal logic, including authentication triggers, error propagation, and state transitions, following a TDD approach.
### Details:
For each identified logic path, write failing unit tests first. Implement or update modal logic to pass these tests. Ensure tests are isolated, maintainable, and well-documented. Cover all edge cases, including error handling and state changes.

## 3. Develop UI Tests for SSO Modal User Flows and Error States [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.2
### Description: Create UI tests that simulate user interactions for Apple and Google SSO, covering successful logins, cancellations, and all error scenarios.
### Details:
Use a UI testing framework to automate user actions such as clicking SSO buttons, entering credentials, and handling error dialogs. Simulate network failures and invalid credentials to verify error handling. Ensure tests are repeatable and cover all documented scenarios.

## 4. Validate UI/UX Compliance with Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.3
### Description: Ensure the SSO modal's appearance, transitions, and interactive elements strictly adhere to the Corporate Style Guide and .cursorrules.
### Details:
Review the modal against the style guide and .cursorrules, both manually and via automated visual regression tests if available. Check for compliance in colors, typography, spacing, transitions, and cursor behaviors. Reference example code as needed.

## 5. Integrate Tests into CI Pipeline and Document as P0 Linked to Task #41 [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.4
### Description: Integrate all tests into the CI pipeline, ensure maintainability, and document the test suite as a P0 task linked to Task #41.
### Details:
Configure the CI pipeline to run all unit and UI tests on each commit. Ensure test results are visible and failures block merges. Add documentation describing test coverage, maintenance guidelines, and the linkage to Task #41. Mark the test suite as P0 priority in project tracking.
