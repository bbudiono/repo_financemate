# Task ID: 27
# Title: Refactor ProfileView.swift for Code Quality, Modularity, Accessibility, and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor _macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/Sources/Views/ProfileView.swift to achieve over 90% code quality and problem rating, with enhanced modularity, accessibility, error handling, and comprehensive documentation per .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.
# Details:
Begin by analyzing ProfileView.swift for code smells, large functions, and tightly coupled logic. Break down monolithic methods into smaller, reusable components and extract logic into helper functions or view models where appropriate. Ensure all UI elements are accessible, providing appropriate accessibility labels, traits, and dynamic type support. Implement robust error handling for all user interactions and data flows, using Swift’s error handling best practices. Add a comprehensive comment block at the top of the file and inline documentation for complex logic, explaining design decisions and rationale. Ensure all changes comply with .cursorrules §6.4.1 (code quality, modularity, and maintainability) and §8.2 (accessibility and documentation). Document every change and the reasoning behind it in a dedicated changelog section within the file. Update or add relevant linter and formatter rules to enforce new standards and prevent regressions. Commit changes incrementally to maintain a clear history and facilitate code review.

# Test Strategy:
Verify code quality and problem rating using automated tools (e.g., SwiftLint, SonarQube) to ensure >90% scores. Manually review the code for modularity, readability, and maintainability. Test all accessibility features using VoiceOver and accessibility inspector tools. Validate error handling by simulating failure scenarios and confirming graceful degradation. Review documentation for completeness and clarity, ensuring all changes and rationales are clearly recorded. Confirm compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2 through peer review and checklist validation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and Identify Refactoring Targets in ProfileView.swift [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review ProfileView.swift to identify code smells, large or monolithic functions, tightly coupled logic, and areas lacking modularity, accessibility, or documentation. Create a prioritized list of specific refactoring targets.
### Details:
Perform a thorough code review using Xcode's code analysis tools and manual inspection. Document all problematic areas, including functions that are too large, repeated logic, and UI elements lacking accessibility features. Note any violations of .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.

## 2. Refactor for Modularity and Code Quality [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Break down large functions and tightly coupled logic into smaller, reusable components. Extract business logic into helper functions or view models as appropriate, ensuring code adheres to Swift best practices and .cursorrules §6.4.1.
### Details:
Use Xcode's refactoring tools (e.g., Extract Method, Rename) to modularize code. Move non-UI logic to view models or helpers. Ensure each function has a single responsibility and is easily testable. Apply Swift coding conventions for readability and maintainability.

## 3. Enhance Accessibility and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.2
### Description: Update all UI elements to provide appropriate accessibility labels, traits, and dynamic type support. Implement robust error handling for user interactions and data flows using Swift’s error handling best practices, in compliance with .cursorrules §8.2.
### Details:
Audit UI components for accessibility compliance using Xcode's Accessibility Inspector. Add or update accessibility modifiers and dynamic type support. Refactor error-prone code to use Swift's error handling patterns (e.g., do-catch, Result types), ensuring user-facing errors are handled gracefully.

## 4. Document Code and Changes per .cursorrules [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.3
### Description: Add a comprehensive comment block at the top of the file, inline documentation for complex logic, and a dedicated changelog section detailing all changes and their rationale, as required by .cursorrules §8.2.
### Details:
Write clear, concise documentation explaining design decisions, rationale for refactoring, and any deviations from standard patterns. Maintain a changelog section within the file, listing each change and its reasoning. Ensure all documentation is up to date and accessible.

## 5. Update Linter/Formatter Rules and Commit Incrementally [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.4
### Description: Update or add SwiftLint and SwiftFormat rules to enforce new code quality and accessibility standards. Commit all changes incrementally with clear messages to maintain a transparent history and facilitate code review.
### Details:
Configure linter and formatter tools to enforce modularity, function size limits, documentation requirements, and accessibility checks. Make incremental commits after each logical change, ensuring each commit is self-contained and well-documented.
