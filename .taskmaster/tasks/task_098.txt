# Task ID: 98
# Title: Implement Level 5 TaskMaster-AI MCP Real API Integration Test
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 97, 77, 74
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and execute comprehensive integration tests to verify TaskMaster-AI's Level 5-6 task decomposition capabilities through actual API calls to the MCP server.
# Details:
This task involves developing a robust integration test suite that validates the TaskMaster-AI's ability to decompose complex requirements into Level 5-6 tasks through real API interactions with the MCP server:

1. Set up a dedicated test environment with controlled test data and isolated MCP server instance to prevent interference with production systems.

2. Create a comprehensive test harness that can:
   - Authenticate with the MCP server using proper credentials
   - Submit various complexity-level requirements to the TaskMaster-AI
   - Capture and validate responses from the AI
   - Measure performance metrics (response time, accuracy, etc.)

3. Develop a set of standardized test cases representing different complexity levels and domains, including:
   - Simple feature requests (Level 3-4)
   - Complex architectural changes (Level 5-6)
   - Cross-functional requirements spanning multiple domains
   - Edge cases with ambiguous or incomplete specifications

4. Implement validation logic to assess the quality of task decomposition:
   - Verify correct dependency chains between generated tasks
   - Ensure appropriate granularity of tasks (Level 5-6)
   - Check for completeness of coverage against requirements
   - Validate test strategies included with each generated task

5. Create detailed logging and reporting mechanisms to:
   - Record all API interactions for debugging
   - Generate test summary reports with success/failure metrics
   - Capture performance statistics for optimization

6. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to deal with API timeouts, rate limiting, or service disruptions.

7. Document the test suite thoroughly, including setup instructions, test case descriptions, and interpretation of results.

The implementation should follow TDD principles, with tests written before the actual integration code. Use appropriate mocking frameworks for initial development, then transition to real API calls for final validation.

# Test Strategy:
The test strategy for this task will involve multiple layers of validation:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each component of the test harness
   - Mock the MCP server responses initially to test error handling and parsing logic
   - Verify correct authentication flow and token management
   - Test validation logic with known good/bad task decompositions

2. Integration Testing:
   - Configure a test environment with a dedicated MCP server instance
   - Execute the test suite against a controlled set of requirements
   - Verify proper API communication (requests/responses)
   - Validate correct handling of various HTTP status codes and error conditions

3. Functional Validation:
   - Submit a diverse set of requirements to the TaskMaster-AI
   - Manually review a sample of generated task decompositions for quality
   - Verify that Level 5-6 tasks include appropriate implementation details and test strategies
   - Confirm correct dependency relationships between generated tasks
   - Check that generated tasks follow project conventions and standards

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure response times for various complexity levels
   - Test system behavior under load with multiple concurrent requests
   - Verify graceful degradation under adverse conditions

5. Acceptance Criteria:
   - The test suite successfully authenticates with the MCP server
   - All test cases execute without errors
   - TaskMaster-AI consistently produces Level 5-6 task decompositions
   - Generated tasks include appropriate dependencies, details, and test strategies
   - Test reports provide clear metrics on success rates and performance
   - Documentation is complete and allows others to run and extend the tests

The final verification will include a demonstration of the test suite running against the production MCP server with real-world requirements, showing the complete flow from requirement submission to task decomposition validation.
