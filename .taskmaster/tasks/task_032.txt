# Task ID: 32
# Title: Refactor AuthenticationService.swift for Code Quality, Modularity, and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor _macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/Sources/Services/AuthenticationService.swift to achieve over 90% code quality and problem rating, with enhanced modularity, robust error handling, comprehensive documentation, and full compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.
# Details:
Begin by thoroughly reviewing AuthenticationService.swift to identify areas of low code quality, tight coupling, or insufficient error handling. Refactor the code to improve modularity—extract reusable components, apply protocol-oriented design where appropriate, and ensure clear separation of concerns. Enhance error handling by introducing descriptive error types and ensuring all failure paths are handled gracefully. Add a full comment block at the top of the file and inline documentation for all public methods and complex logic, following Swift documentation standards. Ensure all changes comply with .cursorrules §6.4.1 (code structure and readability) and §8.2 (error handling and reporting). Document every change and the rationale in a dedicated changelog or as part of the pull request description. Use SwiftLint and other static analysis tools to enforce code quality standards and prevent regressions. Commit changes incrementally to maintain a clear history and facilitate code review.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the refactored AuthenticationService.swift passes all existing and new unit tests, with particular focus on error handling and modularity. Use code quality tools (e.g., SwiftLint, SonarQube) to confirm that the file achieves over 90% code quality and problem rating. Review the code for compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2, ensuring all documentation requirements are met. Manually inspect the comment blocks and inline documentation for completeness and clarity. Confirm that all changes and rationales are clearly documented in the changelog or pull request. Conduct peer code reviews to validate maintainability and adherence to best practices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conduct Comprehensive Code Review and Identify Refactoring Targets [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Thoroughly review AuthenticationService.swift to pinpoint areas of low code quality, tight coupling, insufficient modularity, and weak error handling. Document all findings and prioritize them based on impact and compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.
### Details:
Read through the entire file, noting code smells, large or complex methods, duplicated logic, and any violations of code structure or error handling rules. Create a checklist or annotated copy of the file highlighting each issue and referencing the relevant .cursorrules sections.

## 2. Refactor for Modularity and Protocol-Oriented Design [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Restructure the code to improve modularity by extracting reusable components, applying protocol-oriented design, and ensuring clear separation of concerns.
### Details:
Break down large classes or methods into smaller, focused units. Define protocols for authentication behaviors and refactor implementations to conform to these protocols. Move reusable logic into extensions or helper types as appropriate, ensuring each component has a single responsibility.

## 3. Enhance Error Handling and Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.2
### Description: Introduce descriptive error types and ensure all failure paths are handled gracefully, fully complying with .cursorrules §8.2.
### Details:
Define custom error enums with associated values where needed. Replace generic error handling with specific cases and ensure all thrown errors are documented and handled at call sites. Add logging or reporting mechanisms as required by compliance rules.

## 4. Add Comprehensive Documentation and File-Level Comments [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.3
### Description: Document all public methods, complex logic, and add a full comment block at the top of the file, following Swift documentation standards.
### Details:
Use Swift's documentation comment syntax (///) for methods and properties. At the top of the file, provide a summary, usage notes, and references to .cursorrules compliance. Ensure inline comments explain non-obvious logic or design decisions.

## 5. Enforce Code Quality and Compliance with Static Analysis and Changelog [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.4
### Description: Run SwiftLint and other static analysis tools to enforce code quality standards, document all changes and rationale in a changelog or pull request, and ensure full compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.
### Details:
Configure and run SwiftLint, addressing all warnings and errors. Review the code for compliance with code structure and error handling rules. Prepare a detailed changelog or PR description outlining each change and its rationale. Commit changes incrementally for traceability.
