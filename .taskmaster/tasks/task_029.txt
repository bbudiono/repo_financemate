# Task ID: 29
# Title: Refactor User.swift for Code Quality, Structure, and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor _macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/Sources/Models/User.swift to achieve over 90% code quality and problem rating, with improved data model structure, comprehensive documentation, and full compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.
# Details:
Analyze the current implementation of User.swift and identify areas for improvement in code quality, such as reducing complexity, improving readability, and optimizing data structures. Refactor the data model to ensure clarity, maintainability, and scalability, following Swift best practices. Add a complete comment block at the top of the file and thorough inline documentation for all properties, methods, and logic, ensuring all documentation aligns with .cursorrules §6.4.1 (documentation standards) and §8.2 (data model requirements). Document all changes and the rationale behind each modification in a dedicated section at the end of the file or in a separate changelog. Ensure the refactored code passes static analysis tools (e.g., SwiftLint, Code Climate) and achieves over 90% in code quality and problem rating metrics, referencing tools such as Swift Code Metrics and SCMA for validation[1][5].

# Test Strategy:
Run static analysis tools (SwiftLint, Code Climate, SCMA, or similar) to verify that the refactored User.swift achieves over 90% code quality and problem rating. Review the file to ensure all properties, methods, and logic are fully documented with clear, standards-compliant comments. Confirm that the data model structure is logical, maintainable, and adheres to .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2. Validate that all changes and rationales are clearly documented. Conduct peer code review to ensure compliance, readability, and maintainability, and run all relevant unit and integration tests to confirm no regressions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze User.swift and create refactoring plan [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the current User.swift implementation to identify code quality issues, structural problems, and documentation gaps
### Details:
Use static analysis tools like SwiftLint and Swift Code Metrics to identify specific issues in the current implementation. Document all findings including complexity metrics, code smells, and documentation gaps. Create a detailed refactoring plan with specific goals for improving the model structure, reducing complexity, and enhancing readability. Ensure the plan addresses compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2 requirements.

## 2. Refactor data model structure and properties [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Restructure the User model to improve clarity, maintainability, and scalability following Swift best practices
### Details:
Implement proper property access control (private, fileprivate, internal, public). Replace any stringly-typed properties with strong types or enums. Convert optional unwrapping to use if-let or guard statements. Implement computed properties where appropriate. Use value types for immutable data. Ensure proper initialization patterns. Consider using associated values for enum types where appropriate. Make small, incremental changes with frequent commits to maintain working code throughout the process.

## 3. Optimize methods and reduce complexity [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Refactor methods in User.swift to reduce complexity, improve readability, and enhance maintainability
### Details:
Extract complex logic into smaller, focused methods with clear responsibilities. Replace nested conditionals with guard clauses or early returns. Implement proper error handling using Swift's Result type or throwing functions. Remove duplicate code by creating reusable utility methods. Apply the Single Responsibility Principle to ensure each method does one thing well. Consider implementing extensions to organize functionality by purpose. Update method signatures to use modern Swift patterns like trailing closures where appropriate.

## 4. Add comprehensive documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.3
### Description: Add thorough documentation to User.swift following .cursorrules §6.4.1 documentation standards
### Details:
Create a complete comment block at the top of the file explaining the purpose and responsibilities of the User model. Add documentation comments for all properties, methods, and enums using the standard /// format. Include parameter descriptions, return value explanations, and thrown error details where applicable. Document any complex logic with inline comments. Ensure documentation addresses the 'why' behind implementation decisions, not just the 'what'. Verify all documentation complies with .cursorrules §6.4.1 standards.

## 5. Validate refactored code against quality metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.4
### Description: Verify that the refactored User.swift meets all quality requirements and create a changelog documenting improvements
### Details:
Run static analysis tools (SwiftLint, Code Climate) to verify the refactored code achieves over 90% in code quality and problem rating metrics. Use Swift Code Metrics and SCMA for validation. Fix any remaining issues identified by the tools. Create a dedicated section at the end of the file or a separate changelog documenting all changes made and the rationale behind each modification. Ensure full compliance with .cursorrules §8.2 data model requirements. Update any references to User.swift in other parts of the codebase if the public API has changed.
