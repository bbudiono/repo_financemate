# Task ID: 26
# Title: Refactor SignInView.swift for Code Quality, Modularity, Accessibility, and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor _macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox/Sources/Views/SignInView.swift to achieve over 90% code quality and problem rating, with enhanced modularity, accessibility, error handling, and comprehensive documentation per .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.
# Details:
Begin by analyzing the current SignInView.swift file to identify code quality issues, large or monolithic functions, and areas lacking modularity. Refactor the code by extracting reusable components, adopting Swift best practices (such as using protocols, extensions, and smaller functions), and improving error handling with clear, user-friendly feedback. Enhance accessibility by ensuring all UI elements are accessible via VoiceOver and keyboard navigation, and by providing appropriate accessibility labels and traits. Add a full comment block at the top of the file and inline documentation for all public methods, properties, and complex logic, explaining the rationale for changes. Ensure all modifications comply with .cursorrules §6.4.1 (code quality, modularity) and §8.2 (documentation, accessibility). Document all changes and the reasoning behind them in a dedicated CHANGELOG section within the file or as an accompanying markdown file. Update or add unit and UI tests to cover new and refactored logic, aiming for comprehensive coverage. Use SwiftLint and other static analysis tools to enforce code quality and style guidelines, updating configurations as needed to prevent regressions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the refactored SignInView.swift achieves over 90% code quality and problem rating using the project's code quality tools and .cursorrules evaluation. Review the code for modularity, ensuring components are reusable and functions are concise. Manually test accessibility features with VoiceOver and keyboard navigation, confirming all UI elements are accessible and properly labeled. Review all documentation for completeness and clarity, ensuring compliance with .cursorrules §8.2. Run the full suite of unit and UI tests to confirm no regressions and that all new logic is covered. Check the CHANGELOG or documentation for a clear summary of changes and rationale.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze SignInView.swift and identify code quality issues [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the current SignInView.swift file to identify code quality issues, monolithic functions, and areas lacking modularity
### Details:
Use static analysis tools like SwiftLint to identify code smells and quality issues. Create a detailed report documenting large functions (>30 lines), nested conditionals, duplicated code, and accessibility gaps. Identify areas where error handling is insufficient or unclear. Map out the current architecture and component relationships to understand dependencies and potential extraction points. Check for compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2 requirements.

## 2. Extract reusable components and implement Swift best practices [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Refactor the code by extracting reusable components and adopting Swift best practices to improve modularity and maintainability
### Details:
Break down large functions into smaller, single-responsibility methods. Extract reusable UI components into separate SwiftUI views. Implement protocols and extensions to promote code reuse and better organization. Replace any imperative code with declarative alternatives where appropriate. Use Swift's type system to enforce correctness at compile time, such as replacing stringly-typed code with enums and associated values. Implement proper state management using appropriate property wrappers (@State, @Binding, @ObservedObject).

## 3. Enhance error handling and user feedback mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Improve error handling throughout SignInView with clear, user-friendly feedback and robust error recovery paths
### Details:
Implement a consistent error handling strategy using Swift's Result type or throwing functions. Create dedicated error types with descriptive messages for different failure scenarios. Add user-friendly error messages and recovery suggestions for common errors. Implement graceful degradation for network failures and other external dependencies. Use alerts, banners, or inline messages to communicate errors contextually. Ensure all error states are visually distinct and provide clear next steps for users.

## 4. Implement comprehensive accessibility enhancements [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Ensure all UI elements are accessible via VoiceOver and keyboard navigation with appropriate accessibility labels and traits
### Details:
Add accessibility identifiers to all interactive elements. Implement proper accessibility labels, hints, and traits for all UI components. Ensure proper focus order for keyboard navigation. Test with VoiceOver to verify all content is properly announced. Add appropriate semantic descriptions for images and icons. Implement Dynamic Type support for text scaling. Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text and interactive elements. Add haptic feedback for important interactions.

## 5. Add comprehensive documentation and finalize compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.3, 26.4
### Description: Document all code with inline comments, method documentation, and a complete file header explaining the component's purpose and architecture
### Details:
Add a full comment block at the top of the file explaining the component's purpose, architecture, and usage. Document all public methods, properties, and complex logic with inline comments explaining the rationale. Create a CHANGELOG section documenting all refactoring changes and improvements. Verify compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2 requirements. Run final SwiftLint checks to ensure code quality standards are met. Update project documentation to reflect architectural changes if needed.
