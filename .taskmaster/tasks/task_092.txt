# Task ID: 92
# Title: Design and Implement MVP App Entry Experience
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a user-focused entry experience for the main app entry point, such as a popup landing or 'Get Started' page, prioritizing clarity, engagement, and seamless onboarding for MVP users.
# Details:
Create a visually appealing and intuitive entry page that welcomes users and guides them to the core app functionality. Incorporate best practices such as a clear value proposition, concise onboarding steps, and interactive elements (e.g., welcome message, progress indicator, or checklist). Ensure the design is responsive and accessible. Consider gamification elements (like badges or milestones) to boost engagement, and provide contextual help or tooltips for first-time users. Collaborate with design and product teams to align messaging and visuals with the overall brand and MVP goals. Integrate analytics to track user engagement and onboarding completion rates for future optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the entry page loads correctly across devices and browsers, and that all interactive elements (e.g., buttons, checklists, tooltips) function as intended. Test the onboarding flow with new users to ensure clarity and ease of use, gathering feedback on usability and engagement. Confirm that analytics events are triggered at key onboarding steps. Check accessibility compliance (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support). Review that the experience aligns with MVP requirements and branding guidelines.
