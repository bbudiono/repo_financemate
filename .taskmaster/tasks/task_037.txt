# Task ID: 37
# Title: Refactor and Modularize GoogleAuthProvider for SSO Extensibility and .cursorrules Compliance (P0)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the GoogleAuthProvider in Sandbox to achieve full modularity, testability, and compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §5.3.1, ensuring it is easily swappable and extensible for future SSO providers. Update or add code comments, complexity ratings, and ensure all changes are TDD-compliant, logging this as a P0 refactor task.
# Details:
Analyze the current GoogleAuthProvider implementation and refactor it to maximize modularity and separation of concerns, enabling straightforward replacement or extension for additional SSO providers (e.g., Apple, Microsoft). Abstract provider-specific logic behind interfaces or protocols, and ensure all dependencies are injected to facilitate unit testing. Update or add comprehensive code comments and maintain up-to-date complexity ratings throughout the codebase. Ensure all changes strictly adhere to .cursorrules §6.4.1 (modularity, extensibility) and §5.3.1 (documentation, complexity ratings). Plan the refactor in small, incremental steps to minimize risk, and coordinate with QA for early feedback. Document all architectural decisions and ensure the provider's API is clear and future-proof. Log this as a P0 refactor task in the project tracker.

# Test Strategy:
Adopt a strict TDD workflow: write or update unit tests before refactoring, ensuring all existing and new tests pass after each incremental change. Verify that the refactored provider is fully testable in isolation, and that it can be swapped with a mock or alternative SSO provider in tests. Confirm that all code comments and complexity ratings are present and accurate. Perform code reviews to ensure .cursorrules compliance and modularity. Collaborate with QA to run integration and regression tests, ensuring no authentication or SSO regressions occur. Validate that the provider can be easily extended or replaced without code duplication or breaking changes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Authentication Provider Interface and Abstract Base Class [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement an authentication provider interface and abstract base class that will serve as the foundation for all SSO providers, including the existing GoogleAuthProvider.
### Details:
Define an IAuthProvider interface with core authentication methods (login, logout, validateToken, etc.). Create an AbstractAuthProvider base class implementing common functionality. Ensure the interface includes methods for handling authentication state, token management, and user profile retrieval. Document all methods with comprehensive comments and add complexity ratings according to .cursorrules §5.3.1. Design with extensibility in mind to support future SSO providers.

## 2. Refactor GoogleAuthProvider to Implement New Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Refactor the existing GoogleAuthProvider to extend the abstract base class and implement the authentication provider interface while maintaining all current functionality.
### Details:
Extract Google-specific authentication logic from the current implementation. Implement all required interface methods. Ensure proper dependency injection for all external dependencies. Add comprehensive code comments explaining the Google-specific implementation details. Update complexity ratings for all methods. Ensure the refactored provider maintains backward compatibility with existing code.

## 3. Implement Authentication Factory and Dependency Injection [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.2
### Description: Create an AuthProviderFactory to instantiate appropriate authentication providers and update the dependency injection system to support swappable providers.
### Details:
Develop an AuthProviderFactory class that can create and return the appropriate authentication provider based on configuration. Update the application's dependency injection container to register and resolve authentication providers through the factory. Implement configuration options to specify which provider to use. Ensure the factory follows the singleton pattern and properly handles provider lifecycle. Document the factory with clear usage examples and complexity ratings.

## 4. Update Client Code to Use Provider Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.3
### Description: Modify all client code that currently uses GoogleAuthProvider directly to instead use the authentication provider interface, ensuring loose coupling.
### Details:
Identify all code that directly references GoogleAuthProvider. Update these references to use the IAuthProvider interface instead. Inject the appropriate provider through the dependency injection system. Ensure all authentication flows continue to work with the abstracted interface. Update code comments to reflect the new architecture. Verify compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 regarding modularity and extensibility.

## 5. Create Documentation and Example Implementation of Alternative SSO Provider [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.4
### Description: Document the new authentication architecture and create a skeleton implementation of an alternative SSO provider (e.g., Microsoft or Apple) to validate extensibility.
### Details:
Create comprehensive documentation of the new authentication architecture, including class diagrams and sequence diagrams. Implement a skeleton or mock implementation of an alternative SSO provider (Microsoft or Apple) to demonstrate extensibility. Document all architectural decisions made during the refactoring process. Create a migration guide for developers. Update project documentation to reflect the new authentication system. Ensure all documentation complies with .cursorrules §5.3.1.
