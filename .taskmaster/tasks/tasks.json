      "title": "Test TaskMaster-AI Real API Integration with FinanceMate Document Processing Workflow",
      "description": "Implement and test the integration between TaskMaster-AI API and FinanceMate's document processing workflow that includes OCR, data extraction, and financial analysis capabilities.",
      "details": "1. Create a dedicated integration service class `TaskMasterDocumentProcessingService` that handles API communication with TaskMaster-AI.\n\n2. Implement the following key components:\n   - Authentication handler for secure API access using OAuth tokens\n   - Document upload functionality with multi-part form support for various file formats (PDF, JPEG, PNG)\n   - OCR processing request/response handlers\n   - Data extraction endpoints for financial document parsing\n   - Financial analysis result processing and mapping to FinanceMate data models\n\n3. Develop a queuing system for handling document processing requests:\n   - Implement background processing using DispatchQueue or Operation queues\n   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests\n   - Create a persistent storage mechanism for tracking processing status\n\n4. Create data transformation layers:\n   - Map TaskMaster-AI response formats to FinanceMate document models\n   - Implement validation for extracted financial data\n   - Build error handling for malformed or incomplete data\n\n5. Implement user feedback mechanisms:\n   - Progress indicators for document processing stages\n   - Error messaging with actionable recovery steps\n   - Success notifications with summary of extracted data\n\n6. Add configuration options:\n   - API endpoint configuration for different environments (dev, staging, prod)\n   - Processing priority settings\n   - OCR quality/speed tradeoff options\n   - Timeout and retry policy settings\n\n7. Implement proper error handling and logging:\n   - Categorize errors (network, authentication, processing, validation)\n   - Log detailed error information for debugging\n   - Implement user-friendly error messages\n\n8. Ensure the integration follows security best practices:\n   - Secure storage of API credentials\n   - Data encryption for sensitive financial information\n   - Proper certificate validation for API connections",
      "testStrategy": "1. Unit Testing:\n   - Create mock TaskMaster-AI API responses for different document types\n   - Test authentication flow with valid and invalid credentials\n   - Verify proper handling of various API response codes (200, 400, 401, 500)\n   - Test data transformation logic with sample responses\n   - Validate error handling for different failure scenarios\n\n2. Integration Testing:\n   - Set up a test environment with TaskMaster-AI sandbox API\n   - Create a suite of test documents representing different financial document types\n   - Verify end-to-end document processing workflow with actual API calls\n   - Test concurrent document processing with multiple simultaneous requests\n   - Validate proper handling of rate limiting and service unavailability\n\n3. Performance Testing:\n   - Measure processing time for different document sizes and types\n   - Test memory usage during batch document processing\n   - Verify application responsiveness during background processing\n\n4. User Interface Testing:\n   - Verify progress indicators accurately reflect processing status\n   - Test error message display and recovery options\n   - Validate that extracted data is correctly displayed in the UI\n\n5. Regression Testing:\n   - Ensure existing document functionality continues to work\n   - Verify that offline capabilities remain functional\n   - Test backward compatibility with previously processed documents\n\n6. Security Testing:\n   - Verify secure storage of API credentials\n   - Test for proper handling of sensitive financial data\n   - Validate API connection security with network traffic analysis\n\n7. Create a comprehensive test report documenting:\n   - Test coverage metrics\n   - Performance benchmarks\n   - Identified issues and resolutions\n   - Recommendations for production deployment",
