# Task ID: 22
# Title: Enhance Apple Sign-In UX, Validation, and Accessibility in FinanceMate
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Revamp the Apple Sign-In experience in FinanceMate by improving visual design, UX, error handling, validation, accessibility, and adding a 'Remember Me' feature, ensuring all changes meet corporate style and code quality standards.
# Details:
Redesign the SignInView for Apple Sign-In to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. Apply consistent spacing, padding, and dimensions according to corporate style guidelines. Incorporate smooth animations for transitions and button interactions to create a polished appearance. Implement robust error handling to display clear, user-friendly error messages for all authentication failures or data issues. Validate all user data received from Apple authentication, ensuring required fields (such as email and user identifier) are present and correctly formatted. Enhance accessibility by ensuring all UI elements are properly labeled, support VoiceOver, and are fully navigable via keyboard and assistive technologies. Add a 'Remember Me' option that securely persists the user's authentication state using best practices for sensitive data storage. Ensure all code changes achieve a >90% quality rating as measured by .cursorrules, including comprehensive documentation and adherence to project conventions.

# Test Strategy:
1. Manually review the SignInView for visual improvements, spacing, and adherence to style guidelines on multiple device sizes. 2. Test all animations for smoothness and responsiveness. 3. Simulate authentication errors and verify that user-friendly error messages are displayed. 4. Validate that user data from Apple authentication is correctly checked and handled, including edge cases (missing or malformed data). 5. Use accessibility tools (e.g., VoiceOver, Accessibility Inspector) to confirm all elements are properly labeled and navigable. 6. Test the 'Remember Me' functionality by signing in, closing, and reopening the app to ensure authentication state persists securely. 7. Run .cursorrules code quality checks and confirm a score above 90%. 8. Conduct code review to ensure maintainability and adherence to project standards.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Redesign Apple Sign-In UI for Visual Consistency and Appeal [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Revamp the SignInView for Apple Sign-In to align with corporate style guidelines, ensuring consistent spacing, padding, dimensions, and visual hierarchy. Incorporate smooth animations for transitions and button interactions to create a polished and engaging appearance.
### Details:
Reference Apple Human Interface Guidelines and corporate design standards to update the UI. Use official Apple logo assets and button styles, ensuring correct sizing and placement. Implement animation for button presses and transitions using platform-appropriate frameworks. Review with design team for compliance.

## 2. Implement Robust Error Handling and User-Friendly Messaging [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Enhance error handling for Apple Sign-In by capturing all authentication failures and data issues, displaying clear, actionable, and user-friendly error messages that guide users to resolution.
### Details:
Identify all possible error states from Apple authentication APIs. Map each error to a concise, understandable message. Ensure error messages are accessible and visually distinct. Log errors for diagnostics while protecting user privacy.

## 3. Validate and Sanitize Apple Authentication Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Implement validation logic to ensure all required user data (such as email and user identifier) received from Apple is present, correctly formatted, and sanitized before use or storage.
### Details:
Define validation schema for expected Apple authentication payloads. Check for presence and format of required fields. Handle missing or malformed data gracefully, triggering error handling as needed. Sanitize inputs to prevent injection or data corruption.

## 4. Enhance Accessibility for Apple Sign-In Experience [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Ensure all Apple Sign-In UI elements are fully accessible, including proper labeling, keyboard navigation, and compatibility with screen readers and assistive technologies.
### Details:
Add semantic labels to all interactive elements. Ensure tab order is logical and all controls are reachable via keyboard. Test with VoiceOver and other screen readers to confirm all content and error messages are announced correctly. Follow accessibility best practices from Apple and WCAG guidelines.

## 5. Add and Securely Implement 'Remember Me' Feature [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3, 22.4
### Description: Introduce a 'Remember Me' option that securely persists the user's authentication state, following best practices for sensitive data storage and privacy.
### Details:
Design and implement a toggle for 'Remember Me' on the sign-in screen. Use secure storage APIs (e.g., Keychain) to persist authentication tokens. Ensure opt-in consent and provide a clear way to sign out or revoke remembered sessions. Document security considerations.
