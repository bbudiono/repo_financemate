FinanceMate requires the following environment variables for full functionality. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and configure:

1. **Google OAuth 2.0** (for Gmail integration & Google Sign-In):
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```
   **Setup:** [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) → Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID → Desktop app

3. **Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Copy template
   cp .env.template .env

   # Edit with your credentials
   nano .env

   # .env is gitignored (security) - never commit it
   ```

**Dependencies Documented:**
