## 3. REAL FUNCTIONALITY VALIDATION ✅ PASSED

### System Detection Capabilities
```
Hardware Detection:
✅ CPU Cores: 16 (Real system detection)
✅ Physical Memory: 131072 MB (Real hardware info)
✅ OS Version: macOS 15.5 (Actual system version)
✅ Available Storage: 224164 MB (Real disk space)

Environment Analysis:
✅ Home Directory: /Users/bernhardbudiono (Real path)
✅ User: bernhardbudiono (Real user)
✅ PATH: Real environment variables detected

Provider Detection:
✅ LM Studio: Found at /Applications/LM Studio.app
❌ Ollama: Not installed (accurate detection)
```

### MLACS Core Services
- **SystemCapabilityAnalyzer**: ✅ Uses ProcessInfo.processInfo for real hardware data
- **MLACSModelDiscovery**: ✅ Performs actual file system scanning
- **LocalLLMProviderDetector**: ✅ Detects real installed providers
- **ModelAvailabilityChecker**: ✅ Checks actual model availability
- **No Mock Data**: ✅ All components use real system operations

### Verification Method
- Created and executed real system detection test
- Confirmed actual hardware specifications detected
- Verified real file system access and provider detection
- No placeholder or mock data found in critical paths

## 4. UX COHERENCE ✅ PASSED

### Application Flow
1. **Launch**: Clean app startup with proper initialization
2. **Navigation**: Intuitive sidebar-based navigation
3. **Views**: Consistent layout and styling across all sections
4. **MLACS**: Seamlessly integrated into existing navigation structure

### UI Consistency
- **Design Language**: Consistent across all views
- **Navigation Patterns**: Standard macOS three-panel layout
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture
- **Accessibility**: System icons and standard controls used

### User Experience Flow
```
App Launch → Sidebar Navigation → Section Selection → Content Display
     ✅           ✅                  ✅               ✅
```

### MLACS UX Integration
