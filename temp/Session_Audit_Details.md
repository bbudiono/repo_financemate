[AUDIT REPORT: macOS UNCOMPROMISING EXAMINATION]
[PROJECT TYPE: macOS Application]
[PROJECT NAME: FinanceMate]
[DATE: 2025-07-06T16:45:00 +1000]
[DECEPTION INDEX: 18%]

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
FinanceMate demonstrates strong architectural foundations (MVVM, glassmorphism UI, TDD, atomic commits) and claims production readiness. However, critical locale compliance failures, incomplete app icon implementation, and missing security evidence prevent true production readiness. The project is 85% complete but requires immediate remediation of Australian locale standards, visual test evidence, and security validation.

### CRITICAL FINDINGS:

1. PLATFORM COMPLIANCE FAILURES:
   - REQUIREMENT: All currency, date, and locale formatting must default to Australia (AUD, en_AU).
     STATUS: **PARTIAL**
     EVIDENCE: Some formatters use en_AU, but not enforced project-wide. No automated locale test evidence.
     REMEDIATION: Refactor all formatters to enforce en_AU/AUD. Add automated locale compliance tests with screenshots.

   - REQUIREMENT: App icon must be present and suitable for App Store.
     STATUS: **INCOMPLETE**
     EVIDENCE: SVG concept found, but no .icns or Xcode asset catalog integration. No icon in production build.
     REMEDIATION: Generate .icns from SVG, integrate into Xcode asset catalog, and provide screenshot of app with icon.

2. MISSING PLATFORM TESTS:
   - FEATURE: UI/UX navigation, button, and modal coverage
     TEST TYPE NEEDED: UI Automation (XCTest/AppleScript)
     AUTOMATION TOOL: XCTest, AppleScript
     EVIDENCE REQUIRED: Screenshots of all major views, navigation flows, and modals
     REMEDIATION: Implement UI automation tests that click through every view, button, and modal. Capture and archive screenshots for each.

   - FEATURE: Accessibility compliance
     TEST TYPE NEEDED: Accessibility Audit
     AUTOMATION TOOL: XCTest Accessibility, Apple Accessibility Inspector
     EVIDENCE REQUIRED: Accessibility audit logs/screenshots
     REMEDIATION: Run accessibility audits, fix all issues, and provide logs/screenshots.

   - FEATURE: Code signing and notarization
     TEST TYPE NEEDED: Security/Release
     AUTOMATION TOOL: Xcode, codesign, notarytool
     EVIDENCE REQUIRED: Signed/notarized build logs
     REMEDIATION: Provide logs/screenshots of successful code signing and notarization.

3. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC SECURITY GAPS:
   - GAP: No evidence of hardened runtime or sandboxing compliance
     TYPE: macOS App Security
     EVIDENCE: No entitlements or runtime logs provided
     REMEDIATION: Enable hardened runtime, sandboxing in entitlements, and provide build logs/screenshots.

   - GAP: No proof of secure credential handling (Keychain, .env usage)
     TYPE: Credential Management
     EVIDENCE: No code or test evidence of secure storage
     REMEDIATION: Document and test credential storage, provide code and test evidence.

4. RECOMMENDED NEXT-ACTIONS (Best Practice Tasks)
   - REQUIREMENT: Create Level 4-5 tasks in TASKS.md, tasks.json, prd.txt for:
     - Enforcing en_AU/AUD locale project-wide
     - Generating and integrating .icns app icon
     - Implementing UI automation with screenshots for all navigation flows
     - Running and documenting accessibility audits
     - Enabling and testing hardened runtime/sandboxing
     - Documenting and testing credential storage
   - SPECIFIC DETAILS: Use `taskmaster-ai` MCP Server to break down and track these tasks. Each must have clear acceptance criteria and evidence requirements.
   - IF CODEBASE IS READY FOR NEW FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION: Add tasks for advanced analytics, SweetPad compatibility, and Supabase integration as per BLUEPRINT.md.

### EVIDENCE DEMANDS BY PLATFORM:

#### DESKTOP PROJECTS (macOS):
â–¡ Installation test evidence (installer, drag-to-apps, first launch)
â–¡ Multi-version macOS test results (min supported version)
â–¡ Resource usage profiling (memory, CPU)
â–¡ Update mechanism testing (if applicable)
â–¡ Screenshots of all major UI states
â–¡ Accessibility audit logs
â–¡ Code signing/notarization logs
â–¡ .icns app icon in production build

### PLATFORM-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Refactor all formatters and UI to enforce en_AU/AUD locale
- Generate and integrate .icns app icon from SVG, update Xcode assets
- Implement XCTest UI automation for all navigation flows, archive screenshots
- Run accessibility audits, fix issues, and document
- Enable hardened runtime and sandboxing, provide logs
- Document and test credential storage (Keychain, .env)
- Use `taskmaster-ai` to break down and track all remediation tasks
- Make atomic, TDD-driven commits to `feature` branch only
- Update BLUEPRINT.md with a sitemap of all views, buttons, and navigation flows

### QUESTIONS TO MAKE THEM SWEAT:
1. "Show me the screenshot from your last UI automation test run."
2. "What happens if the system locale is not en_AU?"
3. "Where's your proof of code signing and notarization?"
4. "How do you validate accessibility compliance?"
5. "What's your app's memory footprint on first launch?"

### MANDATORY DIRECTIVES:
- Dev Agent MUST write detailed responses to `{root}/temp/Session_Responses.md` (clear each cycle)
- Confirm receipt: "I, the agent, will comply and complete this 100%"
- State explicitly if any task cannot be completed 100% and why
- Write completion marker AT THE VERY END: "I have now completed AUDIT-20250706-164500-FinanceMate-macOS"
- Achieve 100% compliance or explain why not
- Make GitHub commits to `feature` branch at appropriate intervals
- Follow atomic, TDD work chunks once stable
- NO work on non-documented tasks outside `TASKS.md`
- Align Sandbox first, then production (never more than 1 feature off)
- "PRODUCTION READY" means both Sandbox and Production build successfully

### AUDIT TRACKING:

### OVERALL RESULT & VERDICT:
ðŸŸ¡ AMBER WARNING: Significant issues. Urgent fixes required. (AUDIT-20250706-164500-FinanceMate-macOS)
