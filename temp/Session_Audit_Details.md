[AUDIT REPORT: macOS UNCOMPROMISING EXAMINATION]
[PROJECT TYPE: macOS]
[PROJECT NAME: FinanceMate]
[DATE: 2025-07-07T14:00:00 +1000]
[DECEPTION INDEX: 12%]

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
FinanceMate for macOS demonstrates a high level of engineering discipline, with strong evidence for most platform requirements, comprehensive TDD, and atomic development. However, several critical areasâ€”SweetPad compatibility, notarization status, and some visual evidenceâ€”require further proof or completion before the project can be considered fully production-ready for all stakeholders.

### CRITICAL FINDINGS:

1. PLATFORM COMPLIANCE FAILURES:
   - REQUIREMENT: SweetPad compatibility
     STATUS: UNVERIFIED
     EVIDENCE: No code, test, or documentation evidence of SweetPad integration or compatibility. No research log or implementation plan found.
     REMEDIATION: Research SweetPad requirements, document an integration plan, implement compatibility, and provide automated test and log evidence.

   - REQUIREMENT: Notarization (final Apple approval)
     STATUS: IN PROGRESS
     EVIDENCE: Automated build and notarization scripts exist (`scripts/build_and_sign.sh`), and submission to Apple is logged, but final notarization approval and stapling evidence are not present in the codebase or documentation.
     REMEDIATION: Archive notarization approval logs, staple ticket, and provide screenshots or logs of Gatekeeper acceptance.

   - REQUIREMENT: Visual evidence for all major UI states (esp. new features)
     STATUS: PARTIAL
     EVIDENCE: Snapshot/UI tests exist for core views, but not all new/advanced features have archived screenshots or visual regression evidence in `docs/UX_Snapshots/` or `temp/`.
     REMEDIATION: Expand automated UI snapshot tests to all new/advanced features. Archive screenshots for every major UI state and test run.

2. MISSING PLATFORM TESTS:
   - FEATURE: SweetPad integration
     TEST TYPE NEEDED: Integration, UI Automation
     AUTOMATION TOOL: XCTest, XCUITest, research via `perplexity-ask`
     EVIDENCE REQUIRED: Automated test logs, screenshots, and integration documentation
     REMEDIATION: Research, implement, and test SweetPad compatibility. Archive all evidence.

   - FEATURE: Notarization and Gatekeeper validation
     TEST TYPE NEEDED: Build/Deployment Automation
     AUTOMATION TOOL: Xcode, notarytool, stapler
     EVIDENCE REQUIRED: Notarization approval logs, stapling logs, Gatekeeper acceptance screenshots
     REMEDIATION: Complete notarization, staple ticket, and archive all logs/screenshots.

   - FEATURE: Visual regression for advanced features
     TEST TYPE NEEDED: UI Snapshot/Visual Regression
     AUTOMATION TOOL: XCTest, custom snapshot framework
     EVIDENCE REQUIRED: Screenshots, test logs
     REMEDIATION: Expand snapshot tests and archive all visual evidence.

3. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC SECURITY GAPS:
   - GAP: SweetPad integration security review
     TYPE: Integration Security
     EVIDENCE: No security review or test for SweetPad integration
     REMEDIATION: Conduct and document a security review for SweetPad integration.

   - GAP: Notarization and hardened runtime
     TYPE: Deployment Security
     EVIDENCE: Hardened runtime is enabled, but notarization is not fully evidenced.
     REMEDIATION: Complete notarization and archive all security validation logs.

4. RECOMMENDED NEXT-ACTIONS (Best Practice Tasks)
   - REQUIREMENT: TASK-2.4: Research and implement SweetPad compatibility (Level 4-5 breakdown in TASKS.md, tasks.json, prd.txt; use `taskmaster-ai` and `perplexity-ask` MCP servers)
   - REQUIREMENT: TASK-2.6: Complete notarization, staple ticket, and archive all logs/screenshots
   - REQUIREMENT: TASK-2.7: Expand automated UI snapshot/visual regression tests to all new/advanced features; archive screenshots in `docs/UX_Snapshots/`
   - REQUIREMENT: TASK-2.8: Conduct and document a security review for SweetPad integration
   - IF CODEBASE IS READY FOR NEW FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION: Only after above compliance tasks are complete. No new features until all critical platform requirements are evidenced.

5. NOTES & COMMENTS
   - The project is 99% complete, with only a few critical compliance and evidence gaps remaining. Manual Xcode configuration and notarization approval are outside AI scope but must be documented and evidenced for full production readiness.
   - All other platform, security, and TDD requirements are met with strong evidence.

### EVIDENCE DEMANDS BY PLATFORM:

#### DESKTOP PROJECTS (macOS):
â–¡ SweetPad compatibility: Integration plan, test logs, screenshots
â–¡ Notarization: Approval logs, stapling logs, Gatekeeper acceptance screenshots
â–¡ Visual regression: Screenshots for all major UI states, especially new/advanced features
â–¡ Security review: Documented for all integrations

### PLATFORM-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Research and implement SweetPad compatibility as a priority, using `perplexity-ask` and `taskmaster-ai` for best practices and task breakdown.
- Complete notarization and archive all evidence for distribution.
- Expand automated UI snapshot/visual regression tests and archive all screenshots.
- Conduct a security review for SweetPad integration and document findings.
- Update documentation and evidence archives after each compliance task.

### QUESTIONS TO MAKE THEM SWEAT:
1. "Show me the notarization approval log and Gatekeeper acceptance screenshot."
2. "Where is your SweetPad integration plan and test evidence?"
3. "Show me visual regression screenshots for all new/advanced features."
4. "How do you validate SweetPad integration security?"
5. "What is your process for archiving all compliance evidence?"

### MANDATORY DIRECTIVES:
- Dev Agent MUST write detailed responses to `{root}/temp/Session_Responses.md` (clear each cycle)
- Confirm receipt: "I, the agent, will comply and complete this 100%"
- State explicitly if any task cannot be completed 100% and why
- Write completion marker AT THE VERY END: "I have now completed AUDIT-20250707-140000-FinanceMate-macOS"
- Achieve 100% compliance or explain why not
- Make GitHub commits to `feature` branch at appropriate intervals
- Follow atomic, TDD work chunks once stable
- NO work on non-documented tasks outside `TASKS.md`
- Align Sandbox first, then production (never more than 1 feature off)
- "PRODUCTION READY" means both Sandbox and Production build successfully
