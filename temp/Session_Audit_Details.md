[AUDIT REPORT: macOS UNCOMPROMISING EXAMINATION]
[PROJECT TYPE: macOS]
[PROJECT NAME: FinanceMate]
[DATE: 2025-07-06 00:29:55 AEST]
[DECEPTION INDEX: 0%]

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
The codebase has maintained its state of verifiable quality. All previously implemented tests and features remain intact and correct. The project is now cleared to move beyond remediation and begin core feature development. This audit formalizes the next set of mandatory tasks.

### CRITICAL FINDINGS:

There are no new critical failures. This audit serves as a transition from remediation to new feature implementation. All findings from `AUDIT-20250705-234958-RemediationVerified` remain **PASSED**.

### RECOMMENDED NEXT-ACTIONS (Now Mandatory Directives):

The following tasks are no longer recommendations; they are the primary focus of the next development cycle.

*   **REQUIREMENT:** `TASK-CORE-001: Implement Transaction Management View`.
    *   **SPECIFIC DETAILS:**
        *   **Subtask A (Level 4 - UI):** Build the `TransactionsView`. It must display a list of transactions from Core Data. The view must include UI controls for filtering by date and category, and a text field for searching.
        *   **Subtask B (Level 4 - Logic):** Implement a `TransactionsViewModel` to manage all business logic. This includes fetching, filtering (by date range and category), and searching transactions. All data operations must be efficient.
        *   **Subtask C (Level 5 - TDD):** Develop comprehensive unit tests for the `TransactionsViewModel`. These tests must validate the correctness of the fetching, filtering, and searching logic. Use a mocked Core Data context to ensure tests are fast and reliable.
        *   **Subtask D (Level 5 - UI Test):** Implement snapshot tests for the `TransactionsView`, capturing its appearance in various states: loading, empty (no transactions), displaying a list of transactions, displaying filtered results, and displaying search results.

*   **REQUIREMENT:** `TASK-CORE-002: Implement Add/Edit Transaction Functionality`.
    *   **SPECIFIC DETAILS:**
        *   **Subtask A (Level 4 - UI):** Create the `AddEditTransactionView`, which must be presented as a modal sheet. It needs fields for transaction amount, date, category (as a picker), and a text field for notes.
        *   **Subtask B (Level 5 - TDD):** Create an `AddEditTransactionViewModel`. Write extensive unit tests to cover all data validation logic (e.g., amount cannot be zero, date is valid), as well as the saving (for new) and updating (for existing) transaction logic.

### EVIDENCE DEMANDS BY PLATFORM:

For the next audit cycle, I demand the following evidence:
â–¡ A screen recording (GIF) demonstrating the full user flow: adding a new transaction, editing an existing transaction, and deleting a transaction.
â–¡ A screen recording demonstrating the filtering and searching functionality on the `TransactionsView`.
â–¡ The complete, passing test logs from both the unit and snapshot test suites for the new features.
â–¡ A coverage report indicating >90% test coverage for `TransactionsViewModel` and `AddEditTransactionViewModel`.

### PLATFORM-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:

All currency values must be formatted according to the Australian locale (`en_AU`), displaying the dollar sign ($) correctly. All dates should also adhere to Australian conventions (DD/MM/YYYY). The Glassmorphism theme must be consistently applied to all new views and controls.

### QUESTIONS TO MAKE THEM SWEAT:
1.  "Show me the test that proves your search logic is case-insensitive."
2.  "What happens in the UI if the Core Data fetch operation fails? Show me the snapshot test for the error state."
3.  "How have you ensured that editing a transaction and saving it does not create a duplicate record?"
4.  "Show me the validation test that prevents a user from entering a non-numeric value in the transaction amount field."

### MANDATORY DIRECTIVES:

The Dev Agent MUST:
- Immediately clear `{root}/temp/Session_Responses.md`.
- Create the new tasks (`TASK-CORE-001`, `TASK-CORE-002`) and their subtasks in all project management documents (`docs/TASKS.MD`, `tasks/tasks.json`, `scripts/prd.txt`). The `taskmaster-ai` MCP should be used if available.
- Confirm receipt in the new response file: "I, the agent, will comply and complete this 100%".
- Make all commits for this work to a new `feature/TRANSACTION-MANAGEMENT` branch.
- Write a completion marker in the response file upon completion of all tasks: "I have now completed AUDIT-20250706-002955-CoreFeatureDev..."

### AUDIT TRACKING:
Request ID: AUDIT-20250706-002955-CoreFeatureDev

### OVERALL RESULT & VERDICT:
ðŸŸ¢ GREEN LIGHT: The project's quality baseline is confirmed. The agent is now directed to begin core feature development. (AUDIT-20250706-002955-CoreFeatureDev)
