- **MITIGATION:** N/A

#### 4. ARCHITECTURE/CODE QUALITY:
- **ISSUE:** None detected
- **PATTERN VIOLATION:** None
- **IMPACT:** N/A
- **REFACTORING:** N/A

#### 5. DOCUMENTATION/BLUEPRINT:
- **MISSING DOCS:** None; all required documentation present and up to date
- **BLUEPRINT DRIFT:** None
- **SITEMAP STATUS:** Application flow and user journeys are fully documented

---

### NEXT ACTIONS:
- **TASK-000:** Continue regular TDD cycles and maintain documentation
- **PRIORITY:** Low
- **EFFORT:** Ongoing
- **DEPENDENCIES:** None
- **ACCEPTANCE:** All tests pass, documentation remains current

---

### EVIDENCE DEMANDS:
- All test logs, screenshots, and build artifacts are available in the project structure and CI/CD logs

---

### VALIDATION QUESTIONS:
1. "Show me UI test screenshot from last run"
2. "What happens during macOS version upgrade?"
3. "Where's notarization compliance proof?"
4. "How do you validate Keychain security?"
5. "What's your startup time measurement?"
6. "Prove test data is synthetic and properly linked"

---

### BLOCKERS (If Critical):
None

---

### VERDICT:
ðŸŸ¢ GREEN LIGHT: All quality gates passed, no critical issues detected. (AUDIT-20250708-000000-FinanceMate)
