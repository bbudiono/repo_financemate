- **Automation**: AI suggests splits based on merchant and item patterns
- **Efficiency**: Template system for common allocation scenarios
- **Compliance**: Built-in audit trails for tax office requirements

### Technical Architecture
```
Transaction: "Officeworks - $120.00"
├── Line Item 1: "Office Chair - $80.00"
│   ├── Split 1: Business (100%) = $80.00
│   └── Total: $80.00 ✓
├── Line Item 2: "Personal Notebook - $40.00"
│   ├── Split 1: Business (25%) = $10.00
│   ├── Split 2: Personal (75%) = $30.00
│   └── Total: $40.00 ✓
└── Transaction Total: $120.00

Tax Category Allocations:
- Business: $90.00 (75%)
- Personal: $30.00 (25%)
```

### 🧪 Test Validation SUCCESS
**Test Case:** `testTransactionLineItemSplitting`
- ✅ Creates Transaction with 2 LineItems ("Laptop" $80, "Mouse" $20)
- ✅ Laptop: 70% Business, 30% Personal splits
- ✅ Mouse: 100% Business split
- ✅ Validates split percentages total 100% for each line item
- ✅ Verifies relationship integrity and data persistence
- ✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED** and **TEST PASSED**

## 2025-07-06 21:30 +1000: 🎯 TASK-2.2.4 INTEGRATION COMPLETE - TRANSACTION WORKFLOW UNIFIED

**Audit Reference:** AUDIT-20250707-090000-FinanceMate-macOS  
**Agent:** AI Dev Agent following Enhanced Directive Protocol

### ✅ BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVEMENT: COMPLETE TRANSACTION WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

**REVOLUTIONARY PROGRESS:** Successfully integrated line item management into existing transaction workflow, creating a unified system for both traditional and line item-based transactions.

#### 🎯 COMPLETED TASK-2.2.4: INTEGRATION WITH TRANSACTION WORKFLOW

**INTEGRATION FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:**
- ✅ **Line Items Section**: Added to AddEditTransactionView with glassmorphism.secondary styling
- ✅ **Smart Visibility**: Line items section only appears for expense transactions (not income)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Summary**: Shows current line items with split indicators and balance validation
- ✅ **Real-time Validation**: Ensures line items total matches transaction amount with visual feedback
- ✅ **Navigation Integration**: Seamless flow to LineItemEntryView and SplitAllocationView components
- ✅ **Dual Transaction Support**: Handles both traditional transactions and line item-based transactions
- ✅ **Balance Status Indicators**: Color-coded validation (green=balanced, orange=under-allocated, red=over-allocated)
- ✅ **Australian Locale Compliance**: All currency formatting follows en_AU standards throughout

#### 🏗️ ADVANCED INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE:

**AddEditTransactionView Enhancements:**
```swift
// Line item management state
@StateObject private var lineItemViewModel = LineItemViewModel(context: PersistenceController.shared.container.viewContext)
@StateObject private var splitAllocationViewModel = SplitAllocationViewModel(context: PersistenceController.shared.container.viewContext)
@State private var currentTransaction: Transaction?

// Sheet presentations for line item management
.sheet(isPresented: $showingLineItems) { LineItemEntryView(...) }
.sheet(isPresented: $showingSplitAllocation) { SplitAllocationView(...) }
```

**Intelligent Transaction Handling:**
- **Traditional Transactions**: Direct creation through TransactionsViewModel
- **Line Item Transactions**: Temporary transaction creation for line item management
- **Validation Logic**: Ensures line items total matches transaction amount before saving
- **Data Persistence**: Proper Core Data context management and saving

#### 🎨 USER EXPERIENCE EXCELLENCE:

**Line Items Section Features:**
- **Empty State**: Informative illustration with call-to-action for first-time users
- **Summary Preview**: Shows up to 3 line items with "...and X more" indicator
- **Split Indicators**: Visual pie chart icons for line items with split allocations
- **Quick Access**: Tap split indicators to jump directly to SplitAllocationView
- **Balance Validation**: Real-time validation with clear status indicators

**Visual Integration:**
- **Glassmorphism Styling**: Consistent with app's design system using .secondary style
- **Color-coded Status**: Green (balanced), Orange (under-allocated), Red (over-allocated)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features revealed when relevant
- **Accessibility Support**: Comprehensive VoiceOver labels and keyboard navigation

#### 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION EXCELLENCE:

**Smart Transaction Management:**
```swift
private func openLineItemsManager() {
    // Create temporary transaction only when needed
    // Validate transaction amount before allowing line item management
    // Maintain form state consistency
}

private func saveTransaction() {
    // Dual-path handling for traditional vs line item transactions
    // Comprehensive validation including line item balance checking
    // Proper Core Data persistence with error handling
}
```

**Lifecycle Management:**
- **onChange Handlers**: Refresh line items when returning from management views
- **State Synchronization**: Keep transaction form in sync with line item changes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly messages
