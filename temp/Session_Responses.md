## 🚀 REVOLUTIONARY FEATURE: LINE ITEM SPLITTING SYSTEM

### Core Innovation
**Problem Solved**: Manual expense allocation across tax categories is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks audit trails

**FinanceMate Solution**: 
- **Precision**: Split any expense by percentage across multiple tax categories
- **Automation**: AI suggests splits based on merchant and item patterns
- **Efficiency**: Template system for common allocation scenarios
- **Compliance**: Built-in audit trails for tax office requirements

### Technical Architecture
```
Transaction: "Officeworks - $120.00"
├── Line Item 1: "Office Chair - $80.00"
│   ├── Split 1: Business (100%) = $80.00
│   └── Total: $80.00 ✓
├── Line Item 2: "Personal Notebook - $40.00"
│   ├── Split 1: Business (25%) = $10.00
│   ├── Split 2: Personal (75%) = $30.00
│   └── Total: $40.00 ✓
└── Transaction Total: $120.00

Tax Category Allocations:
- Business: $90.00 (75%)
- Personal: $30.00 (25%)
```

**Audit Reference:** AUDIT-20250706-170000-FinanceMate-macOS
**Agent:** AI Dev Agent

### 🎯 BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVEMENT: TASK-2.1 COMPLETE

**REVOLUTIONARY PROGRESS:** Successfully implemented complete Core Data model for line item splitting with programmatic entity definitions and comprehensive test validation.

### ✅ Actions Completed
1. **Fixed Core Data Architecture Issue**: Discovered PersistenceController uses programmatic model, not .xcdatamodeld file
2. **Implemented Programmatic Entities**: Added LineItem and SplitAllocation entities to PersistenceController with proper relationships
3. **Updated Swift Models**: Fixed property name mismatches (itemDescription vs name) and added missing relationships
4. **Added Convenience Methods**: Created LineItem.create() and SplitAllocation.create() methods
5. **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Updated testTransactionLineItemSplitting with comprehensive validation scenarios
6. **Fixed Relationship Cardinality**: Used minCount/maxCount instead of read-only isToMany property

### 🧪 Test Validation SUCCESS
**Test Case:** `testTransactionLineItemSplitting`
- ✅ Creates Transaction with 2 LineItems ("Laptop" $80, "Mouse" $20)
- ✅ Laptop: 70% Business, 30% Personal splits
- ✅ Mouse: 100% Business split
- ✅ Validates split percentages total 100% for each line item
- ✅ Verifies relationship integrity and data persistence
- ✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED** and **TEST PASSED**

### 🏗️ Technical Implementation
```swift
// Core Data Programmatic Model (PersistenceController.swift)
- Transaction Entity: id, date, amount, category, note, lineItems (1:many)
- LineItem Entity: id, itemDescription, amount, transaction (many:1), splitAllocations (1:many)  
- SplitAllocation Entity: id, percentage, taxCategory, lineItem (many:1)

// Swift Models (Transaction.swift)
- Added convenience creation methods
- Proper relationship definitions
- Comprehensive documentation per .cursorrules
```
