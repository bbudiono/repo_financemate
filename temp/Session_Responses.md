## ðŸŽ¯ PROCEEDING WITH TASK-2.3.3.B: CONTEXTUAL HELP & GUIDANCE

### AUDIT RECOMMENDATION ANALYSIS
**Recommended Action:** TASK-2.3.3.B: Contextual Help & Guidance implementation  
**Foundation Available:** Feature gating and adaptive UI systems provide intelligent user profiling  
**Approach:** Atomic TDD methodology leveraging existing infrastructure  
**Priority:** Medium (P4 Feature Implementation following successful audit completion)

### "ULTRATHINK" PLANNING: CONTEXTUAL HELP SYSTEM

**Objective:** Create intelligent, context-aware help system that provides just-in-time assistance  
**Complexity Assessment:** Medium-High (contextual intelligence, adaptive coaching, multimedia content)  
**Dependencies:** FeatureGatingSystem (âœ… complete), ProgressiveUIController (âœ… complete), UserJourneyTracker (âœ… complete)  
**Architecture Pattern:** MVVM with @MainActor compliance

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ANALYSIS:
- âœ… Create smart help system that provides just-in-time assistance
- âœ… Implement context-aware tips for split allocation optimization  
- âœ… Add interactive walkthroughs for complex financial workflows
