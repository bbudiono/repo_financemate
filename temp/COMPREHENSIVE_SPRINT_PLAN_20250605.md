# COMPREHENSIVE SPRINT PLAN: FinanceMate Production Deployment
**Generated:** 2025-06-05  
**AI Agent:** Claude Code  
**Objective:** Complete FinanceMate from current state to production-ready deployment

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current State Analysis:
- ‚úÖ **Backend API Integration**: RealLLMAPIService.swift working with OpenAI API
- ‚úÖ **TaskMaster-AI**: Configured and functional for task management
- ‚úÖ **Apple SSO Framework**: Exists but needs verification
- ‚úÖ **Global .env Configuration**: Working for API keys
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL GAP**: Chatbot UI not functional (backend works, frontend missing integration)
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL GAP**: Button/modal wiring incomplete
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL GAP**: Production deployment pipeline missing

### Mission-Critical Gaps:
