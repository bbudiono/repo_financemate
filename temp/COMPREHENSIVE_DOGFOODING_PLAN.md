## EXECUTION STATUS
- Phase 1: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - API works perfectly
- Phase 2: üöß IN PROGRESS - Swift service testing
- Phase 3-7: ‚è≥ PENDING

## EVIDENCE COLLECTED
1. ‚úÖ Python API test: SUCCESS - OpenAI responded with financial context
2. ‚úÖ API key validation: SUCCESS - Key loaded from global .env
3. ‚úÖ Network connectivity: SUCCESS - HTTPS connection established
4. üöß Swift service test: IN PROGRESS - Verifying RealLLMAPIService

## NO SHORTCUTS TAKEN
- Using actual API calls, not mocks
- Testing with real global .env file
- Verifying actual responses, not placeholder text
- Testing production-level error scenarios
