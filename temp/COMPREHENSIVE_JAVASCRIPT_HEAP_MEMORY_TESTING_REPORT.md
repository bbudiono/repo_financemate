- Stability: Requires active memory management

## PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### üö® CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED

1. **Memory Management Integration**
   ```javascript
   // Integrate memory management solution into TaskMaster-AI
   const memoryManager = new MemoryManagementSolution();
   
   // Before creating Level 5-6 tasks
   if (!memoryManager.isOperationAllowed('level6_tasks')) {
       // Fallback to simpler task or queue for later
   }
   ```

2. **Memory Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time heap usage monitoring
   - Circuit breaker status display
   - Memory pressure alerts
   - Automatic GC triggering

3. **Production Memory Limits**
   ```
   Recommended Node.js flags:
   --max-old-space-size=6144  // 6GB heap limit
   --expose-gc                // Enable manual GC
   --inspect                  // Enable debugging
