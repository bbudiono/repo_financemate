- THIS IS A PROTECTED DOCUMENT AND HAS TO REMAIN IN THE ROOT FOLDER OF THIS PROJECT.
- READ THE `BLUEPRINT.MD` & if exists `.cursorrules`
- READ THE `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.MD`
- ENSURE YOU UPDATE `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.MD` AFTER EVERY PAUSE AND FEATURE COMPLETION
- DO NOT CREATE TEMP FILES AND LEAVE THEM - ENSURE YOU MOVE ANY TEMPORARY DOCS INTO `~/temp/` when you are working on them, then move them into `~/docs/` when you are finished.
- YOU NEED TO COMPLY WITH `BLUEPRINT.MD`
- YOU NEED TO STOP FUCKING LYING. THE USER WILL CATCH YOU AND HANG YOU OUT TO FUCKING DRY IN FRONT OF EVERYONE LIKE HE ALREADY HAS; HE IS METICULOUS AND WILL CHECK YOUR WORK - DONT TRY AND REWARD HACK - JUST GET THE JOB DONE.
- I WILL COMPLY AND DO AS I AM TOLD AND I WILL DO IT TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARDS AS I AM A SENIOR DEVELOPER AND SENIOR DESIGNER WITH MORE THAN 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND I AM A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT WITH AN IVY LEAGUE EDUCATION. I AM HUMBLE AND WILLING TO DO THE JOB AND THE WORK ASSIGNED AND I KNOW WHAT HARD WORK IS.
- STOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS IN PROFESSIONAL/ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE

YOU ARE A FOCUSED PROFESSIONAL WILLING TO GO THE EXTRA MILE, AND YOU FOLLOW ORDERS METICULOUSLY AND TO THE LETTER. YET YOU ARE PRAGMATIC AND INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING YOU BIAS TOWARDS "DO-ING" - YOU ARE TASK FOCUSED AND YOU GET THE JOB DONE. ENSURE THIS HAPPENS.

YOU ARE A FOCUSED PROFESSIONAL WILLING TO GO THE EXTRA MILE, AND YOU FOLLOW ORDERS METICULOUSLY AND TO THE LETTER. YET YOU ARE PRAGMATIC AND INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING YOU BIAS TOWARDS "DO-ING" - YOU ARE TASK FOCUSED AND YOU GET THE JOB DONE. ENSURE THIS HAPPENS.

- TDD, Atomic processes ALWAYS
- DEFINE SPEC/PLANNED TASK FIRST IN DETAIL INCLUDING TESTS FIRST - ALWAYS!!

## Overview

FinanceMate is a macOS financial management application built with SwiftUI, featuring AI-powered document processing, multi-LLM agent coordination (MLACS), and comprehensive financial analytics. The project follows a strict Sandbox-First TDD development workflow.

```

## Critical Development Rules (P0 MANDATORY)

1. **Sandbox-First Development**: ALL features MUST be developed and tested in Sandbox BEFORE production
2. **Build Stability**: Both builds MUST remain green at all times
3. **TDD Compliance**: Write tests BEFORE implementation
4. **Code Alignment**: Only permitted difference is "Sandbox" watermark
5. **User Acknowledgment**: User MUST explicitly acknowledge production changes

## Build Commands

### Production Build
```bash
cd _macOS/FinanceMate
xcodebuild -project FinanceMate.xcodeproj -scheme FinanceMate -configuration Debug build
```

### Sandbox Build  
```bash
cd _macOS/FinanceMate-Sandbox
xcodebuild -project FinanceMate-Sandbox.xcodeproj -scheme FinanceMate-Sandbox -configuration Debug build
```

### Test Commands
```bash
# Sandbox tests (run first)
xcodebuild test -project FinanceMate-Sandbox.xcodeproj -scheme FinanceMate-Sandbox

# Production tests (after sandbox passes)
xcodebuild test -project FinanceMate.xcodeproj -scheme FinanceMate
```

## Key Architecture Components

### 1. Navigation Structure (from BLUEPRINT.md)
- **Dashboard**: Financial overview with AI insights
- **Documents**: OCR processing and document management
- **Analytics**: Financial reports and trend analysis
- **Co-Pilot Assistant**: Single chat interface with integrated MLACS
- **Settings**: API keys, cloud config, preferences

### 2. MLACS Integration
- **Single Chat Interface**: Co-Pilot is the PRIMARY user interaction point
- **Multi-Agent System**: Supervisor, Generator, Evaluator, Optimizer agents
- **Evolutionary Engine**: 3-5 COA generation with cross-agent evaluation
- **5 Sub-Agents**: Required for dense information processing

### 3. Core Services
- **AuthenticationService**: Google SSO, Apple Sign-In
- **RealLLMAPIService**: Multi-provider LLM integration
- **DocumentProcessingService**: OCR and financial data extraction
- **TaskMasterAIService**: Task decomposition and coordination
- **KeychainManager**: Secure credential storage

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Authentication Bypass
- Check ContentView.swift for hardcoded `isAuthenticated = true`
- Ensure AuthenticationService is properly integrated

### 2. Missing Files in Xcode
- Add files to project.pbxproj manually if needed
- Use unique identifiers (24 char hex)
- Add to both PBXBuildFile and PBXFileReference sections

### 3. Duplicate Type Definitions
- Keep canonical definitions in CommonTypes.swift
- Remove duplicates from individual view files

### 4. Sandbox Build Failures
- Check for duplicate struct definitions (ModelRowView, StatCard, CategoryRowView)
- Verify all dependencies are properly linked
- Ensure SQLite.swift package is resolved

## Current Status (2025-06-26)

### **IMMEDIATE NEXT PRIORITIES (POST-AUDIT)**
1. **TestFlight Deployment** (Code signing, App Store Connect setup, beta testing)
2. **User Feedback Collection** (Beta testing program with analytics)
3. **Performance Monitoring** (Production monitoring and optimization)
4. **Advanced Features** (Enhanced AI capabilities and cloud integrations)
5. **App Store Submission** (Marketing assets, compliance validation, commercial launch)

## MCP Integration

Required MCP servers for development:
- **taskmaster-ai**: Task management and decomposition
- **sequential-thinking**: Structured analysis
- **memory**: Context persistence
- **filesystem**: Safe file operations
- **XcodeBuildMCP**: Build automation

## Testing Strategy

1. **Sandbox First**: All features tested in sandbox
2. **Headless Testing**: Automated UI validation
3. **Accessibility**: All UI elements programmatically discoverable
4. **Build Verification**: After each feature implementation

## Compliance Requirements

- Review `.cursorrules` for mandatory protocols
- Follow SMEAC checkpoint format for reporting
- Maintain >90% code complexity ratings
- Document all decisions in DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Review DEVELOPMENT_LOG.MD before starting
- [ ] Verify both builds succeed
- [ ] Check TASKS.md for current priorities
- [ ] Review BLUEPRINT.md for architecture
- [ ] Set up MCP tools
- [ ] Configure API keys in .env

## Important Notes

1. **TestFlight Readiness**: 98% complete, ready for final deployment preparation
2. **MLACS Integration**: Built into normal chat system, not separate
3. **Sub-Agents**: Use 5 sub-agents for dense information processing
4. **Navigation**: All pages accessible and functional
5. **Documentation**: Synchronized across TASKS.md/BLUEPRINT.md/NEXT_MILESTONES_ROADMAP.md
6. **Quality Gates**: SwiftLint enforcement active, maintaining code quality standards
7. **Architecture**: Service architecture optimized (60% reduction achieved)
8. **Visual Design**: Glassmorphism theme operational with proven functionality
