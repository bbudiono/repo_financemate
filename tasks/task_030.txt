# Task ID: 30
# Title: Refactor AppDelegate.swift and Main.swift for Code Quality, Lifecycle, and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor _macOS/DocketMate-Sandbox/Sources/App/AppDelegate.swift and Main.swift to achieve over 90% code quality and problem rating, with enhanced lifecycle management, comprehensive documentation, and full compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.
# Details:
Analyze the current AppDelegate.swift and Main.swift for code quality issues, excessive responsibilities, and lifecycle handling gaps. Apply best practices such as the Composite or modular delegate pattern to break down large, monolithic logic into smaller, single-responsibility components, improving maintainability and testability[1][5]. Ensure all lifecycle events are handled robustly and edge cases are covered. Add full comment blocks to all classes, methods, and significant logic sections, following Swift documentation standards. Review and update code to comply strictly with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2, documenting every change and the rationale behind it in a dedicated changelog or inline comments. Ensure the refactor does not introduce regressions and that the codebase remains easy to extend and test[2].

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the full test suite before and after refactoring to ensure no regressions. 2. Use static analysis tools (e.g., SwiftLint, SonarQube) to verify code quality exceeds 90%. 3. Manually review lifecycle event handling for correctness and completeness. 4. Check that all classes and methods have comprehensive comment blocks and that documentation is clear and accurate. 5. Validate compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2 via code review. 6. Review the changelog or inline documentation to confirm all changes and rationales are thoroughly recorded.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and document current AppDelegate.swift and Main.swift structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the current code structure, identifying code quality issues, excessive responsibilities, and lifecycle handling gaps in both files.
### Details:
Create a detailed report documenting the current architecture, responsibilities, and code quality metrics. Identify specific areas that violate single responsibility principle, have poor testability, or contain complex logic that should be refactored. Map out all lifecycle events currently handled and note any missing edge cases. Document all instances of non-compliance with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2.

## 2. Design and implement Composite Delegate pattern [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Refactor the AppDelegate using the Composite Design Pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
### Details:
Create a composite AppDelegate that delegates responsibilities to smaller, focused components. Implement an AppDelegateFactory to encapsulate creation logic. Define protocol(s) for delegate components with clear interfaces. Create specialized delegate components for distinct responsibilities (e.g., UI setup, notifications, deep linking, etc.). Ensure each component has a single responsibility and can be tested in isolation.

## 3. Enhance lifecycle management in Main.swift [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Refactor Main.swift to improve application lifecycle handling with robust error handling and edge case coverage.
### Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling for application startup and shutdown sequences. Add proper state management to track application lifecycle. Ensure graceful handling of unexpected terminations and crashes. Implement logging for all lifecycle events. Separate configuration code from initialization code. Create clear separation between app setup and app running phases.

## 4. Add comprehensive documentation and comments [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.2, 30.3
### Description: Add thorough documentation to all classes, methods, and significant logic sections following Swift documentation standards.
### Details:
Write documentation comments for all public APIs using Swift's documentation comment format (///). Include parameter descriptions, return value explanations, and thrown exceptions. Document complex algorithms with step-by-step explanations. Add code examples where appropriate. Create class-level documentation explaining responsibilities and relationships. Document any design patterns used and their implementation details. Ensure all documentation is consistent in style and depth.

## 5. Ensure compliance with .cursorrules and create changelog [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.2, 30.3, 30.4
### Description: Verify and update code to comply with .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2, documenting all changes in a detailed changelog.
### Details:
Review all refactored code against .cursorrules §6.4.1 and §8.2 requirements. Make necessary adjustments to ensure full compliance. Create a detailed changelog documenting each significant change made during the refactoring process, including the rationale behind design decisions. Run final code quality metrics to verify >90% code quality and problem rating has been achieved. Perform a final review to ensure no regressions were introduced and that the codebase remains extensible and testable.
