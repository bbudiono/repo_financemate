### üöÄ TASKMASTER-AI MCP COMPREHENSIVE SPRINT PLAN: 125+ TASKS (Generated 2025-06-05)

**INTEGRATION COMPLETE:** TaskMaster-AI MCP server successfully integrated with multi-model coordination

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** RealLLMAPIService.swift works perfectly with OpenAI API, but ChatbotIntegrationView not connected!

### TASKMASTER-AI MCP INTEGRATION STATUS
‚úÖ **Multi-Model Support**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Perplexity, Google, Mistral, OpenRouter, XAI
‚úÖ **Advanced Task Orchestration**: Complex task breakdown and dependency management
‚úÖ **JSON Task Format**: Structured task representation with metadata
‚úÖ **Hierarchical Dependencies**: Parent/child relationships with dependency tracking
‚úÖ **Level 5-6 Task Tracking**: Granular task decomposition with 125+ actionable items
üîÑ **Cross-File Synchronization**: Tasks synchronized across all project documentation

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY TASKS (P0 Critical)
- UI-001: Connect RealLLMAPIService to ChatbotIntegrationView (P0 - Live chat functionality missing)
- UI-002: Wire ChatbotPanelView to use RealLLMAPIService instead of DemoChatbotService (P0 - Backend works, frontend broken)
- UI-009: Audit all buttons in sidebar navigation for functionality (P0 - Many buttons non-functional)
- TEST-059: Implement headless testing orchestrator (P0 - No automated testing framework)

### TASKMASTER-AI SPRINT PHASES (5-Week Production Timeline)
- **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Critical UI/UX Completion - Tasks 1-25 (Live chat integration, button wiring, accessibility)
- **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Backend Integration & API Validation - Tasks 26-50 (Multi-LLM support, auth, data management)
- **Phase 3 (Week 3)**: Testing & Quality Assurance - Tasks 51-75 (TDD implementation, headless testing, quality metrics)
- **Phase 4 (Week 4)**: Production Deployment - Tasks 76-100 (Build automation, App Store prep, performance optimization)
- **Phase 5 (Week 5+)**: Enhancement & Polish - Tasks 101-125 (Advanced features, system enhancements, UX polish)

### TASKMASTER-AI SUCCESS METRICS
- **Task Structure Compliance**: All tasks follow TaskMaster-AI JSON format
- **Hierarchical Dependencies**: Clear parent-child and dependency relationships
- **Multi-Model Coordination**: Tasks designed for Anthropic, OpenAI, Perplexity collaboration
- **Test Coverage**: >95% for critical paths
- **Performance**: <2s app launch, <500ms response times
- **User Experience**: >95% task completion rate
- **Quality Score**: >90% average code quality
- **Production Ready**: App Store submission in 5 weeks
